            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Occaſion of this Second Part of Letters was briefly this: When the Author had withſtood the first Aſſault of the Adverſaries Papers, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have clos'd up and reſted there; he was ſet upon afreſh by another Packet, the Adverſary deſigning either to weary him with Work, or to worry him with Cavils and ſo to make him drop the Cauſe, to be rid of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Trouble of defending it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the Author knowing the Wiles and Artifices of the Party, and how apt they are to triumph without a Victory, found it neceſſary to take this Second Packet into Conſideration: And the better to bring this Matter to ſome good Iſſue, began to treat with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary upon his own Conceſſions; which
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:31614:4"/>if ſtood to, ſeem'd to bid fair for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: But he fearing a Snake in the Graſs, and doubting lest by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Thing after another, he might be drawn in to give up the whole Cauſe, abruptly broke off the Treaty, return'd the Authors Letters, and would hear no more of an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>That the World therefore might ſee the inexcuſable Obſtinacy and Perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Man, the Author was deſir'd to Publiſh this Second Part; in which not only the trifling Exceptions of the Adverſary, but all the material Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the whole Party are briefly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd; and that with as much Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gentleneſs too, as the Cauſe could well admit of: For the Reader will find, that nothing bites but Truth; and all the Salt and Smartneſs in it is deſign'd meerly to ſeaſon the Diſcourſe, and not to fret the Party.</p>
            <p>I know the Adverſaries Complaint is hard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, which is wont to be the last Refuge of a bad Cauſe; and this
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:31614:4"/>hath betray'd him into an indecent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and many unſeemly Expreſſions, which are to be paſs'd by as the Follies and Frailties of depraved Nature: But how little Reaſon there is for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, any wiſe Reader may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; for he hath been rather gently ſtroak'd than roughly handled, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives have been never us'd, but where Lenitives could work no Effect. A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſeaſonable Rebuke hath been ever reckon'd among the good Offices of a Friend, not the Wounds of an Enemy; And I think upon the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Matter, the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary may ſee greater Cauſe to commend the Faithfulneſs, than to complain of the Hardſhip of ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage.</p>
            <p>After this Second Part was gone out of my Hands to the Preſs, there comes forth a Book, Entituled, <hi>A Contract Anſwer to my Correct Copy of Letters:</hi> In which, beſides ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and rude Calumnies (the uſual Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Choler and the feeble Supports
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:31614:5"/>of a ſinking Cauſe) the Reader will find nothing material, that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to in the following Letters.</p>
            <p>In the Preface he tells us, <q>
                  <hi>That a Civil Peace being reſtor'd, 'tis greatly deſir'd, that the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial War were at an end.</hi>
               </q> Now are not theſe Peaceable Men, to continue a War with their Superiors upon Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of meer Ceremony? Or can they be thought to deſire Peace, who reſolve to differ and contend about ſuch indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Things? But how would they have this Ceremonial War ended? Muſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors ſubmit to them, or they to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors? For this is the great Queſtion. If they would but know their Station, and pay the Duty they owe to the Lawful Commands of thoſe that are ſet over them, this Ceremonial War would ſoon ceaſe; but if nothing will pleaſe them, but to over-rule Authority, and do as they list; 'tis plain they are Enemies to Peace, and whilst they ſpeak thereof, are but making ready for Battel.</p>
            <pb n="v" facs="tcp:31614:5"/>
            <p>So that themſelves are plainly the Perſons he ſpeaks of in the following Words, <hi>who inſtead of allaying, inflame the Differences and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities at home:</hi> For are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles the Nurſeries of Diſcord and Diviſion? And do not all the Flames of Contention and Animoſity ariſe and break out from thence? This all Men ſee but Themſelves, who are too wiſe to be in an Error, and too holy to be in a Fault.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis with great Reluctance</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>that he bears any part in this preſent Controverſy:</hi> Though himſelf began it by reviling the Doctrin and Diſcipline of the Church; and ſtill continues it, by abuſing the People with falſe Notions of Both without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However being engag'd, Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>extorted an Anſwer to my Letters:</hi> Now what was this Neceſſity? Why, there was a double Neceſſity in the Caſe; the one to anſwer the Importunity of the Party, that would
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:31614:6"/>not be ſatisfied without it: The other to keep up the Ceremonial War, which elſe would ſoon come to a happy end. To prevent which, he hath revok'd or at leaſt omitted ſome Conceſſions in the Print, which were granted in his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Papers, beſide other groſs Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, too many to be here recited.</p>
            <p>In the next place, To excuſe his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, he complains of my Rambling, which is the old way of ſhifting a Fault, by charging it on another: In proving of which he falls into this evident Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> That I diſcours'd in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, not of Prayer in general, but only of Vocal, or as he calls it, Miniſterial Prayer; which is a notorious Falſity, and the rotten Foundation of his whole Book; For my Deſign was to Treat of the Gift of Prayer in general, Mental as well as Vocal. Both which agree in the Nature of Prayer, and differ only in the manner of performing it, the one being done with Silence, and the other with the Voice, which are only
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:31614:6"/>Cicumſtances of the Duty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I plac'd the Gift of Prayer (as it ſhould be) in ſomething that was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Neceſſary to both theſe; to wit, not in an ability of Expreſſions, which is nothing elſe, but the Gift of Speech applied to the Matter of Prayer, and is peculiar only to vocal Prayer; but in an ability of lifting up the Heart in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deſires and Devotion unto God, which is common to mental and vocal Prayer, and neceſſary to the right performance of both. Again,</p>
            <p>To exclude mental Prayer out of the Controverſy, he would exclude it out of the Devotions of the Church: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we ſearch into the Devotions of the antient Chriſtians, we ſhall find the ſilent Breathings of mental Prayer, made up a great part of them: Their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service was performed partly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with Silence; and partly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with the uſe of the Voice: And we read of ſecret mental Prayers us'd by Chriſtians in the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:31614:7"/>in the Intervals between the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices, when all the Congregation kept Silence, and theſe were made and offer'd up, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite &amp; Modeſte inter ipſas Pectoris Latebras.</hi> Silently and Modeſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Secrets of their own Breaſts. So that as the Nature, So the Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be ſo defin'd, as to extend to, and comprize both: The not knowing or conſidering this hath led him into this Miſtake, of reſtraining the Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only to that which is Vocal; by which means he paſſeth by that which is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Common with it to the ſeveral kinds of Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> the elevation of the Heart; and places the Gift of it in an Ability of Expreſſions, which belongs only to vocal Prayer, and that too not as 'tis Prayer, but only as 'tis Vocal, which hath occaſion'd that vulgar Error, of calling the Gift of Speech applied to the Matter of Prayer, by the Name of the Gift of Prayer.</p>
            <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:31614:7"/>
            <p>This plainly ſhews the Falſhood of what he affirms about the State of the Queſtion, that 'tis not concerning Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in general: And likewiſe the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of what follows, in calling his Gift of free Prayer, by the Name of Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Prayer: As if the great Work and Duty of the Miniſtry, lay in Praying by theſe Effuſions, and none were to be admitted to the Miniſterial Function, that cannot or will not venture to Pray Extempore. But is not Praying by a Liturgy or publick Forms Miniſterial Prayer? And are there no well qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they do not preſume to utter any things haſtily before God, or uſe this Talent of free Prayer?</p>
            <p>Beſide, do not many among the Laity Exerciſe, and as he ſaith, Excel too in this Gift? How comes it then to be ſtil'd Miniſterial Prayer? Do the People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Miniſters Office, when they Pray Extempore? Into what groſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities hath theſe wrong Notions led
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:31614:8"/>him? And yet upon theſe and many other Miſtakes is his whole Anſwer ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which having ſo bad a Foundation, all the Frame and Superſtructure rais'd upon it muſt fall with it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Yet he is fully ſatisfied</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>That ſincere Prayer, whether conceiv'd or compos'd, is as ill choſen an Enemy as any can light on; for 'tis dangerous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and difficult to conquer it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, how tender ſoever he may be of conceived Prayers; 'tis plain, he can load compos'd Devotion with the blackeſt Reproaches; for Liturgies are with him only the Brats and Imps of Darkneſs, the effects of the Ignorance and Lazineſs of the Clergy, and the product of a Dark and degenerate Age. <q>
                  <hi>Whereas free Prayer</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is the Iſſue of a Meridian Light, and none can triumph in the Conqueſt of it.</hi>
               </q> For the Proof of which, he tells us of a Triumphant Paper in the time of the Civil Wars, that had this Expreſſion in it,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:31614:8"/>
               <hi>Nil reſtat Superare Regem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which being Ambiguous</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>was conſtrued in a double Senſe, viz.</hi> Either that nothing remain'd, but for the King to conquer the Prayers of the Fanaticks, or for the Prayers of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to conquer the King: And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks Prayers it ſeems had the best on't, for they brought that good King to the Block, and made three once flouriſhing Kingdoms miſerable and unhappy ever ſince: A glorious and triumphant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievment of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer. Moreover, it ſeems by him, That the Oaths of the one Party were <hi>Extempore</hi> Effuſions, as well as the Prayers of the other, and 'tis not eaſy to ſay, which did the most Miſchief.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>But he is not</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>upon equal Terms with the Vicar in this Controverſie:</hi>
               </q> How ſo? Does the Inequality lie in the goodneſs of the Vicars Cauſe? That's a great Inequality indeed. Or does it lie in the greater Power and Authority that backs it? This
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:31614:9"/>is true too (tho' he will ſcarce acknowledg it) for the one is eſtabliſh'd, and the other only wink'd at: But the Vicar may ſay any thing against free Prayer; And hath not he ſaid the worſt he can againſt Liturgies? 'Tis to be fear'd, if ſome Men had the Power, they would ſcarce give the liberty they take; and this Shew of Modeſty, is only an Excuſe for their too great Boldneſs.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome dainty Remarks in the Cloſe of his Preface, that must not be paſs'd by. As</p>
            <p>Firſt, he very wiſely blames me for not printing a Letter, that was never intended for the Preſs, but deſign'd only for a private Check of his Vanity, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Liturgy as defective upon a particular Occaſion: And likewiſe for diſparaging ſome Reverend Clergy-men, in a Matter that plainly appear'd to be a Notorious Falſity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He complains that I corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my Letters, before they were ſent to the Preſs: Now I think he is the first
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:31614:9"/>Perſon, that ever blam'd any Author for ſo doing; which is ſo far from a Fault, that it would be great Folly in any to do otherwiſe: And yet he hath inſtill'd this ſilly Objection into his credulous Followers, who are thereby perſuaded, that 'tis as neceſſary to print as to pray <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi> But</p>
            <p>That which renders this monſtrouſly groſs and inexcuſable, is, that himſelf, or ſome Body for him, hath far out-gone me, in the very thing he complains of: For tho' my Letters had only the ordinary and uſual Corrections that Books are wont to have that are ſent to the Preſs, and all the Additions and Alterations may be compriz'd in a Phraſe-leaf; his are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, chang'd and almost corrected all away; inſomuch that tho' I had ſeen and read the Letters before, and have a Copy of them by me, yet they are ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, that I can ſcarce know them again. And tho' <hi>J. M.</hi> be in the Title-Page, yet for the moſt part, I am to ſeek for the True Author.</p>
            <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:31614:10"/>
            <p>Now if the little I did in this kind were well done, why does he complain? If it were ill done, why does he imitate it? Yea, and run ſo far into the other Extreme? For his are not only corrected, but for the most part made anew; and like ſome of our old Ships, have undergone ſo many Emendations, that few of the firſt Materials are remaining. But</p>
            <p>There is yet a worſe thing than all this, for tho' he grants that he denied me a Correct Copy, and his Conſent for publiſhing them, any otherwiſe than by the firſt rude Draught which muſt have unavoidably expos'd him to the World, and might have afforded juſt cauſe of Complaint, yet he ſtill complains of what I ſaid of his not conſenting to publiſh them; which ſhews that either he doth not know, or will not own when he is civilly dealt with.</p>
            <p>I ſhall detain the Reader no longer from looking into the Merits of the Cauſe, when I have minded him of one Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Party having with much difficulty procur'd this Book, they have now got ſomething to ſay, namely that mine is anſwer'd, tho' it matters not how, or by whom. And tho' any underſtanding Reader may eaſily ſee the Weakneſs of it, yet they triumph in it as an unanſwerable Piece, and reſolve before-hand not to hear or read any thing, that may be ſaid or written againſt it; which ſhews them to be very juſt and impartial Judges.</p>
            <p>However, ſince ſuch weak, or rather wilful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are impatient of Truth, and reſolve to ſhut both their Eyes and Ears againſt it, do thereby plainly appear to be prejudiced and incompetent Judges in the Caſe: The whole Matter is referr'd to the better Judgment of more knowing and leſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd Readers. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <head>LETTER I. To <hi>J. M.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Receiv'd another Packet of Letters from you, in which I find you trying your Skill in making ſome Replies to my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Gift and Forms of Prayer; but to how little purpoſe, I hope to make you ſenſible by degrees: And to that end, all that you offer in them, of any moment, ſhall be conſider'd in due time and order.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt then, for the Letters that concern the Gift of Prayer, your own Conceſſions ſeem to bid fair towards an Accomodation: For you begin to ſee, that an Ability or Variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are (tho' vulgarly, yet) improperly and abuſively ſtyl'd, The Gift of Prayer. For in your Letter of <hi>April</hi> 1ſt, you tell me, you can well enough grant that ſuch an Ability as you mention, is not properly the Gift of Prayer, and that 'tis only the Gift of uttering Prayer; and comfort your ſelf with this, That however improper it may be, you are not the firſt that have ſo ſtyl'd it. This is a good Conceſſion, if you would keep to it; for hereby you may ſee Prayer to be no Verbal, but Spiritual thing; and conſiſts mainly in the inward Deſires and Breathings of the Soul after God. In your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31614:11"/>Letter of <hi>April</hi> 15th, you own this Ability to be ſuch a Gift as that, by which the Phariſees, Hypocrites, and all wicked Men are ſaid to pray: Which muſt be very improperly call'd by the ſacred Name of Prayer; ſince 'tis All no better than an Abomination to the Lord.</p>
            <p>If then this Gift doth not properly lie there, there muſt be ſome other thing in which it may be more properly placed; And the Knowledge of that would clear up this matter. What then ſhould that be? Why, we ſee it muſt lie either in the Heart or the Tongue; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> either in the pious motions of the one, or in the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ready motion of the other. Now I think you will ſcarce venture to put it in the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tongue, which is apt to run too faſt, and out of the way too, and may not be truſted without a Bridle: And therefore the Pſalmiſt reſolved to keep his Mouth as it were with a Bridle, to reſtrain its Extravagance, and to look to his Ways, that he might not offend with his Tongue. And St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That <hi>He that offends not with his tongue,</hi> (eſpecially when let looſe) <hi>muſt be a perfect man.</hi> So that this Gift cannot be ſafely plac'd there; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince the whole Work and Buſineſs of Prayer may be perform'd without it. Now if you would but ſpeak out, and make the Heart the proper place of it, which is indeed the true Seat of all Devotion, there might be a ſpeedy end of that part of the Controverſy.</p>
            <p>And the better to encourage you to ſpeak out, in a matter of this Conſequence, conſider (Sir) the three different ways of addreſſing or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh unto God, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt is with the Heart, and that is performed by the inward Deſires and Elevations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31614:11"/>of the Mind and Soul to him; and this is very truly and properly ſtyled Prayer, and is all that is Eſſential to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second is with the Lips, when the Heart is far from Him: And this may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called vain talking and babling, than pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third is with the Heart and Lips to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (that is) when the Heart and the Tongue accompany each other. And this is that Vocal Prayer uſed in publick; whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, with one Mind and one Mouth, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our Great Creator. Now here two things are carefully to be diſtinguiſh'd; the one is an Ability of lifting up the Heart in holy Deſires unto God: And this is properly the Gift of Prayer; the other is an Ability of expreſſing thoſe Deſires, and putting them into fit Words: And this is properly the Gift of Speech, Utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Elocution; the uſe whereof in Prayer, is to help us to join together in our Requeſts, and to put up the ſame Petitions. And this is far better done in the known conſider'd Words of godly Forms, than the ſudden Effuſions of free Prayer.</p>
            <p>(Sir) If you well conſider and digeſt this, your Eyes might ſoon open, and diſcern between the Gift of Prayer, and the Gift of Speech; and that the Heart is the proper Seat of the one, as the Tongue is of the other. The confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe two different things, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded your Notious about it; whereas the diſtinguiſhing between them, would ſhew you the different Nature and Place of both. And this is the more carefully to be diſtinguiſhed and attended to, becauſe the want of it hath led many into great and dangerous Miſtakes:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31614:12"/>For he that can uſe moſt new Words, and hath the beſt Faculty of changing and varying Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is by too many, thought to pray beſt. And the ordinary Gift of Prayer which you talk ſo much of, and would have ſtudied and practis'd by Miniſters and People, is nothing elſe than this Faculty of Variations; which is rather a hindrance than furtherance of true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: And yet you ſeem to put the Life and Spirit of Prayer chiefly in it: For you tell me, That the ſame Words are apt to deaden and cloy; and that all Men are delighted with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and new things. And to ſhew what a mighty Streſs you lay upon ſuch Novelties, your Brethren are wont to ask, whether he that ſings ſtill the ſame Song, or is always telling the ſame Story, would not make thoſe that hear him, to grow weary and ſick of them? Thence inferring, that the daily and conſtant uſe of the ſame Prayers, will have the ſame Effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Minds of the People, who are therefore to be entertain'd with new.</p>
            <p>But is there no difference (think you) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe things? Are not Songs and Stories, things merely intended to gratifie the Senſes, and pleaſe the Fancy, which is beſt taken with new things? And are theſe to be compar'd with the ſublime and weighty Matters of Religion, which are deſign'd to affect the Heart, and are ſtill exercis'd about the ſame things? The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of humane Life, beſt attain their end, by Change and Variety; but muſt we be given to change too in Matters of Religion, and hunt about for new Words and Phraſes, when we addreſs to God for the ſame things? I hope you do not think that God Almighty is taken with new things, ſince all the Pleaſure of them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31614:12"/>is occaſion'd chiefly from Suddenneſs and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; and therefore cannot affect him, to whom nothing can be new: And we find wiſe Men, who are govern'd more by Judgment than Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are but little affected with ſuch things. So that 'tis only vulgar Minds and ſuch as are moſtly led by Imagination, that are thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Novelty and Sound of Words; and ſeek about for Variety of Expreſſions. Now this is a Weakneſs in them, which you ſhould be ſo far from cheriſhing and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you ought rather to uſe your beſt Skill, to perſwade them out of it; and to let them know, that God neither expects nor is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with theſe things. For true Religion inclines ſtill to the doing and ſpeaking the ſame things: He that endeavours to keep up a conſtant Reverence and Fear of God in his Heart; and by a daily continued Practice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the ſame Bleſſings in the ſame Words, ſhall be more ſoberly and religiouſly devout, and find better Acceptance with him, than he that loves and labours for new Words, and thinks he ſhall not be accepted without a Multitude or Variety of Expreſſions: The Study whereof is more apt to diſtract, than compoſe the Mind, in this Duty.</p>
            <p>Indeed, where God in his Providence hath done any new thing, either by ſending ſome new Judgment or Calamity; or by beſtowing ſome new Mercy or Deliverance; here, in our publick Faſts and Thankſgivings there muſt be ſuch new Words, as may ſuit ſuch Occaſions: And (Thanks be to God) the pious Care and Wiſdom of our Governours, is never wanting to make a due and ſuitable Proviſion for us, on ſuch Occaſions: But for the conſtant Matter of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31614:13"/>our daily Prayers and Praiſes, there can be no need of new Words, but only to bring new Hearts and good Affections, in the uſe of the old well-digeſted Words, and Compoſures of the Church. We read of our Saviour's pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three times moſt earneſtly, uſing the ſame Words; ſo that theſe can neither hinder the Earneſtneſs, nor the Efficacy of true Devotion. In the Prayer that Chriſt gave his Diſciples, and in all the Prayers he put up himſelf, he hath left no Command or Example, for ſuch unneceſſary Variation; but rather the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and therefore you are to conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how you will excuſe it from Superſtition, to think that God is pleas'd with many and new Words; or diſpleas'd without them: Which is to place Religion in things which God hath no where requir'd at your hands, and to lay a doctrinal Neceſſity in the Inventions of Men: Which is a piece of Will-worſhip and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>As for the Multitude of Words, <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſhew'd that to be an Occaſion of Sin,
<note place="margin">Prov. 10.19.</note> and an Inſtance of great Folly;
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.2.</note> and therefore wills that our Words unto God ſhould be few: And our Bleſſed Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> or much ſpeaking of the Heathens, and all that imitate them.</p>
            <p>And as for the Change and Variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in Prayer, there is not the leaſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a Command or Encouragement for it in Holy Scripture; for tho' we are bid [<hi>To pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.18.</note>] That is by the ſame Apoſtle expounded of the ſeveral parts of Prayer, but is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31614:13"/>underſtood by none,
<note place="margin">1 Tim 2.12.</note> of <hi>extempore</hi> or varied Prayers. So that to make it a Miniſterial Duty, to pray without Book; and to put the Vulgar upon beating their Brains for new Phraſes, as a more ſpiritual way of praying; cannot be excuſed from Vanity and Superſtition. Yea, a Learned and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divine hath ſhew'd this to be a ſort of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: <q>For the Miſ-repreſentation of God, and worſhipping him according to that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation is the Sin of Idolatry.</q> Now, to think to pleaſe God with new and varied Phraſes in Prayer, is to miſ-repreſent him; and to take him for ſuch an one as our ſelves: and by offering up ſuch Prayers, we worſhip him according to that Image and falſe Repreſentation of him: And therefore 'twill be hard to excuſe this Practice from the Sin of Idolatry: <q>Yea, ſuch Perſons, not only repreſent God under the Shape of a Man, but pray to him as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the Weakneſſes of a Man. And certainly, if the Miſ-repreſentation of the Object makes the Idolatry; by how much the worſe the Repreſentation is, by ſo much the groſſer muſt the Idolatry be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>(Sir) If you will throughly weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, you will find, That the main Work and Buſineſs of Prayer lies in the Heart and the good Motions of it: And therefore the Gift or Ability of performing it, muſt properly be placed there.</p>
            <p>So that your great Miſtake all this while, hath been in taking the Gift of wording Prayer, for the Gift of Prayer: To rectifie which, you muſt know that Words are no part of Prayer; or if they were, the well-conſider'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31614:14"/>Words of a Form, are far more agreeable to the Nature and Dignity of this Duty, and the Majeſty we addreſs to, in it; than any preſent and haſty Expreſſions. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Gift of compoſing pious and well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Forms for publick and private Devotion, is in this Senſe far more fitly ſtyl'd, the Gift of Prayer, than your Talent of Extemporary Effuſions.</p>
            <p>But at raſt, I find you (in that Letter of <hi>April</hi> 15th) acknowledging, that the offering up pious Deſires to God, without the uſe of any Words, is Prayer in a proper Senſe; and that pious Souls who are duly affected with their Wants, Sins, and Mercies, may be ſaid to have the Gift of Praying acceptably to God in a ſpiritual manner, without them: Where you ſeem to place the Gift of Prayer, as it ſhould be, in the Heart: Yea, all your own Arguments and Diſtinctions, if well conſider'd, do moſt properly and principally place it there. For, what you call the ſpecial, internal, devout, ſpiritual, and ſucceſsful Gift, is truly the Gift or Grace of Prayer: And what you ſtyle the common, external and artificial Gift, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Gift of Speech, Utterance and Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applyed to the Duty of Prayer. And for the Novelty and Variety of Words, you grant in your Letter of <hi>April</hi> 1ſt, that 'tis no further neceſſary, than as the various Matter and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions require. So that (Thanks be to God) by theſe Conceſſions, that part of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is come to a pretty good Iſſue.</p>
            <p>It remains then that you endeavour to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the People, and take them off from their vain and high Thoughts of this Verbal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31614:14"/>Gift: That they may return to the Ancient, Publick, and Devout Prayers of the Church, from which they have ignorantly ſwerved.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Conſider'd in my laſt, the Letters relating to the Gift of Prayer; and finding nothing of moment objected againſt them, that may need or deſerve a farther Anſwer; I proceed to the Letters that relate to Forms of Prayer: About which, two Things are chiefly to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>(viz.)</hi> (1ſt) their Lawfulneſs, and (2dly) their Expediency. And that we may bring Things to ſome good Iſſue, I will ſhew, how far we are agreed, that we may the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promize Matters where we differ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, We are agreed about the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Forms of Prayer: For, in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of (<hi>June</hi> 28th) you acknowledge Forms to be in themſelves lawful; and to ſome, needful; and complain of your being miſ-repreſented by ſome, as Enemies to all Forms.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diſputation of Liturgy, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> 10.</note> Your Oracle, [Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>] fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſerts the lawfulneſs of them, and withal declares, <q>That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31614:15"/>the diſuſe of Forms, is apt to breed a giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Religion, and to make Men Hypocrites, who delude themſelves with Conceits that they delight in God, when it is but in theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and varieties of Expreſſion that they are delighted; and therefore adviſeth Forms, to fix Chriſtians and make them ſound.</q>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſon, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi>
               </note> And another Brother of yours acknowledges, <q>That their Labours are profitable, who have drawn the matter of Prayer into Forms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, theſe Conceſſions, one would think, were a fair ſtep to a Reconciliation; and might lay a good Foundation for Peace and Unity: For this Principle, if well obſerv'd and follow'd, would bring all to the Church, and help them to join in the ſame Forms of Publick Worſhip, from which, nothing but their unlawfulneſs, can juſtifie a Separation. St. <hi>Paul</hi> wills us <hi>[To do what in us lies, to live peaceably with all Men,]</hi> Rom. 12.18. and more eſpecially with the Church whereof we are Members: And elſewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us, To uſe our utmoſt Endeavours <hi>[To keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.]</hi> Epheſ. 4.2 Now does it not lie in us, to do what we lawfully may? Should we not go as far as we can, for the ſake of Peace and Unity? Eſpecially when we are commanded to do ſo, by lawful Authority? And what a mighty influence would this Amicable and Chriſtian Temper have, to promote Unity, and prevent Diviſions? For if we lawfully may, and ought (as this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple teaches) to agree in offering up the ſame Prayer (which will have the greater force from the benefit of Concord and Unanimity) why ſhould we break into Parties, and put up different and contrary Petitions, which muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31614:15"/>loſe all their Efficacy, from the miſchief of Diviſion?</p>
            <p>'Tis evident (Sir,) that you can and do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion join in the Publick Prayers of the Church: Which ſhews you are ſatisfied both in the lawfulneſs and uſe of them: Now, what ſhould hinder you from doing that, always for the ſake of Peace, which you can do ſometimes, to ſerve ſome other Turn? Was ever Peace and Unity valued at ſo low a rate among Chriſtians, as to refuſe to do what they lawfully may to preſerve it?</p>
            <p>As for what you object of renouncing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as a hinderance; That is long ſince out of doors, and cannot now with any ſhew or colour of Reaſon be pretended: Only you find it in Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and being ſomething to ſay, you cannot forbear to uſe it, tho' the Author and the Covenant too, are both laid aſleep in their Graves.</p>
            <p>As for Re-ordination, which you mention as another hinderance: Neither can that affect you, being (if I am not miſ-inform'd) ordain'd by a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>And as for Aſſent and Conſent to all that is Eſtabliſhed, which you talk ſo often, and ſo much of; tho' it be in its ſelf very reaſonable, and no more than is required in all Eſtabliſhed Churches and Societies, yet if you cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come to it, you are to acquieſce and wait for farther Satisfaction; which, if you bring but a willing and humble Mind, you may ſoon have: In the mean time, you are to continue as a private Member of the Church, without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace of it, either by ſeparating from it your ſelf, or drawing the People from it, by Objections wherein they are no way concern'd.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31614:16"/>This (Sir,) is unqueſtionably your Duty, if you will keep a good Conſcience, and ſhew that Modeſty that becomes you, without giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to that Church, whereof you were Baptiz'd a Member, and Ordain'd a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>But the Miſery is, tho' you are driven by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth, to own the lawfulneſs of Forms, yet there is nothing which you more univerſally decry and diſuſe in the Practice; even when enjoyn'd by that Power, which in all lawful Things you are bound to obey. This is a groſs inconſiſtence, and plainly ſhews that you have no mind to do what you ſafely may, to promote Peace. Is not this to act quite contrary to the Apoſtles Advice, <hi>[Nevertheleſs whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame Things?]</hi> Phil. 3.16. Where he wills us, to go hand in hand together, as far as we can; and not to differ or break off from the uſe or practice of thoſe Things, wherein we are agreed. If we have attain'd to the Knowlege and Belief of the lawfulneſs of Forms, we are here required to join together in the uſe of them, when the Peace of the Church, and the Authority of Superiours make it neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Certainly (Sir,) he that will not do what he may, to preſerve Unity, is an Enemy to Peace, and hath another Game to play, that is better promoted by Diviſions: And he that will not obey Magiſtrates in lawful and indifferent Things, ſhakes off the Yoke, and will obey only what he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>But there is not (ſay you) a clearer Proof againſt Impoſitions, than the following Words, [<hi>If any be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you;] not Man by his Laws, enforce it upon you.</hi> But how is this to be revealed unto
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31614:16"/>you? I hope you do not expect an immediate Revelation, or voice from Heaven to ſatisfie you in this Matter; or think that you are ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in your Error, till you have ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to convince you: Is it not ſufficient, that God hath in his Word revealed this unto you, by appointing Forms of Prayer and Praiſes both in the Old and New Teſtament? And what clearer Revelation will you have of this Divine Truth? Yea, is not this Ordinance of God, Eſtabliſhed by the Ordinance of Man too, which we are commanded to ſubmit unto [<hi>for the Lord's ſake]? If you believe not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets</hi> (as our Saviour ſpeaks in another Caſe) <hi>neither will ye believe tho' One roſe from the Dead.</hi> Luke 16.31. If ſo plain a Revelation of this Truth will not convince you, neither will you be convinc'd, tho' it were revealed to you from Heaven.</p>
            <p>But you tell me, If all lawful Things may be enjoyn'd by Superiours in the Worſhip of God, then Spittle and Cream in Baptiſm, Croſſing at the Euchariſt, and abundance more of ſuch Popiſh Trumpery, may be enjoined by them; which you endeavour to prove law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>Are you ſure (Sir,) that 'tis lawful to clog the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, with ſuch needleſs, burdenſome, and inſignificant Things? Indeed, Decency and Order, and Edification require a few Ceremonies, and ſuch as are expreſſive of Reverence, and help to promote the inward Piety and Devotion of the Mind; but does not the ſame Decency and Edification forbid too many, and ſuch as are vain and unſerviceable to thoſe Ends? 'Tis certain, that the Worſhip of God cannot be perform'd without ſome Ceremonies;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31614:17"/>and why may not Superiours make choice of ſuch, as are recommended in Scripture, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the practice of ancient Times, for the greater Solemnity and Uniformity of Publick Worſhip, and muſt theſe be rejected, becauſe they have not thought fit to burden it by requiring more? To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et forth Religion in ſome neceſſary, comely, and ſignificant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is to recommend and make her look fair and amiable in the Eyes of the World; but to dreſs her up in a multitude of gariſh and uſeleſs Habiliments, is to expoſe, and make her appear ridiculous to the Beholders.</p>
            <p>But if theſe Things were lawful, which is much to be doubted, what need is there to fear the enjoining of thoſe Things which the Church hath wiſely caſt out? If you look into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before the Common Prayer, you may ſee the Reaſons why the Church thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome of the ancient and decent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and to lay aſide thoſe frivolous and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome ones which you mention: And is it not a Vile Reflection on the Wiſdom of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours both in Church and State, to ſuſpect the introducing of that, which upon prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they have rejected? Eſpecially, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given ſo good Reaſons, for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>Beſides, is it a fit pretence (think you) for not doing what is required, for fear of other and worſe things being required upon the ſame grounds? This is (as a Reverend Prelate hath obſerved) as if a Son ſhould refuſe to put off his Hat at his Father's Command, leſt he ſhould be commanded to put off his Shoes, and be led on further to kiſs his Toe, which is a Token of Reſpect ſomewhere; (or,) as if a Man ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31614:17"/>refuſe to wear the Badge or Habit of his Office or Degree, for fear he ſhould be required to wear a Fool's-Coat. Every one can ſee the Folly of ſuch Objections in theſe things, tho' too many are ſo blinded with Intereſt and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, as not to diſcern it in weightier Matters.</p>
            <p>But <hi>there are ſome things lawful</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that are too mean and trivial to be made the matter of a Command, as an Injunction to have our Eyes ſhut or open in time of Prayer,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>And muſt you not have mean and trivial Thoughts of Superiours, to ſuſpect the injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things, as if they had nothing to do but to trifle away their Time and Authority about ſuch ſlight Matters? But I hope you do not reckon Forms of Prayer among thoſe mean trivial things, which have been ever thought fit and neceſſary in all Chriſtian Churches: And yet you are ſo vain, as to tell me in that Letter, <hi>That Superiours would be more favourable to you in theſe Matters, if they were not hinder'd by others, who obſtruct all their Deſigns of Peace and Concord.</hi> As if they themſelves did not conſider what they did, but were meerly led on and acted by others, and would gladly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, what upon great Advice and Deliberation, they have thought fit to be done, if they were but left to themſelves: Yea, though in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Forms, they have acted in Conformity to all Antiquity, yet there can be no Peace or Concord till they lay them aſide, and do as you would have them. What think you, is not this arrant Pride and Hypocriſie, thus to magnifie your ſelves, and to ſeek by a few fulſome Flatteries to Atone for ſuch vile Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:31614:18"/>
            <p>But tho' <hi>all things are lawful</hi> (ſay you) yet all things <hi>are not expedient.</hi> And this will lead me to conſider the Expediency of Forms of Prayer, which ſhall be done in my next. In the mean time, I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shew'd in my laſt, our Agreement about the Lawfulneſs of Forms of Prayer, and the Obligation that thence lies upon us to join in the uſe of them, for the Maintenance of Peace and Unity.</p>
            <p>2dly. I come now to conſider the Expediency of them, and to ſee how far we agree here, the better to adjuſt the Matters in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. For the Proof of this Expediency, I refer you to my 7th Letter, and likewiſe to my Sermon preach'd and publiſh'd for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of an eminent Diſſenter, in which you will find this Matter handled and proved at large.</p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis to be hoped, That you are not ſo far from owning this Expediency, as ſome may imagine: For in your Letter of <hi>July</hi> 5th, you have theſe Words [<hi>For the Lawfulneſs and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31614:18"/>Expediency of Forms of Prayer, in ſome Caſes and to ſome Perſons, none of us do deny</hi>] This looks like a pretty hopeful Conceſſion, and a farther Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to an Accommodation; if the Straitneſs of the Limitations do not ſpoil all. Let us ſee then, what are the Caſes, and who are the Perſons, in reſpect of whom you grant the Expediency or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency of Forms?</p>
            <p>And theſe (as far as I can gueſs by your Letters) relate partly to the difference of Times; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the difference of Mens Abilities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, for the difference of Times, you tell me in your firſt Letter, That <hi>you ever thought the Liturgy an excellent Work for the Time in which it was Compoſed; but you believe that the Compilers of it never dreamt of Poſterities being confin'd to it, and the Miniſters of future Generations being obliged to uſe that and no other in their publick Miniſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why ſhould you believe ſo? Did not thoſe pious and excellent Perſons live in the conſtant Uſe, and die in the Defence of the Liturgy? Yea, we read of ſome who laid it next their Hearts, and hugg'd it in the very Flames. And did they ever dream (think you) that ſuch a reform'd and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Compoſure ſhould be laid aſide to make way for <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer? They did not make a New Liturgy, but reformed the Old, and only purg'd it from the corrupt Additions and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Popery. And why ſhould you believe that Men ſo little given to Change, ſhould be ſo willing to part with ſuch a wiſe and well-ordered Eſtabliſhment? Or, that they ever dreamt of a ſort of double Refiners that ſhould refine again upon them, and reform it all away?</p>
            <p>This is a precarious Conjecture, and taken up without any colour of Reaſon; eſpecially ſince all their learned Succeſſors have ever ſince as much
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31614:19"/>reverenc'd and kept to it, as the firſt Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
            <p>But you take Forms of Prayer to be expedient only in Times of Darkneſs and Ignorance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they were never calculated for Times of greater Light.</p>
            <p>But (Sir,) were there ever Times of greater Light, than the Days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, when Life and Immortality were brought to light by the Goſpel, and Error, and Ignorance vaniſh'd like Darkneſs at the Approach of the Sun? And yet we find Forms of Prayer preſcribed and uſed in thoſe bright and glorious Times: For, did not <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was a burning and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Light, teach his Diſciples to pray by a Form? If you have any doubt of this, you will find it proved by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> beyond all Contradiction. And that Chriſt himſelf, who was the great Light of the World, taught his Diſciples a Form, is too plain in ſacred Writ to be called in Queſtion. And was this done (think you) to keep Men in Darkneſs, or to help them out of it?</p>
            <p>If we go on to the following Ages; When were there greater Lights ſet up in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, than in the Days of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> &amp;c.? And yet all theſe were either Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of Liturgies themſelves, for the uſe of their ſeveral Churches, or Approvers and Uſers of ſuch as were compoſed by others. And will you reckon the pious Compoſures of theſe great Lights, among the Works of Darkneſs? — To come down to the Times of the Reformation, When did there appear greater Lights in the Horizon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, than <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> and the other Compilers of our Liturgy? And what admirable Wiſdom, Piety and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31614:19"/>have they ſhewed in the compiling of it, which make it a Work little leſs than Divine; and, next to the Inſpired Writings, hath nothing extant in the Chriſtian World to exceed or equal it? And is it expedient (think you) that this ſhould give place to the preſent and haſty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of every empty Brain? But</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> You limit the Expediency of Forms not only by the difference of Times, but by the difference of Mens Abilities. And this you are ſo full of, that you vent it almoſt in every Letter, frequently vaunting of yours and ſome others mighty Talent, and great Abilities of expreſſing themſelves fitly to God in Prayer, without Forms. But (Sir,) were not thoſe eminent and learned Perſons before-mentioned, who compos'd and us'd Forms of Prayer, Men of far greater Parts and Abilities than ſuch as now vainly pretend to be above them? Can every conceited Holder-forth (think you) pray better than St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> and other Ancient Fathers, who were famed for their Eloquence and great Abilities, and yet thought fit to uſe Forms in their publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations? Yea, do not the moſt able and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, in the preſent as well as former Ages, celebrate the publick Worſhip by Forms, whoſe Abilities are well known to be much greater than theirs, who think they have no need of them?</p>
            <p>Beſides (Sir,) 'tis a Miſtake to think, that any ſuch great Abilities are requiſite to this <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> way of praying: A great deal of Confidence with very ſlender Abilities, is ſufficient to do the Feat: Your ſelf tell me (in your 2d Letter) that you know a great many who have this Gift of expreſſing themſelves fluently this way, that have no Gift of Elocution or Readineſs of Speech upon any other Occaſion.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:31614:20"/>
            <p>The Truth is, <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer when 'tis beſt and moſt dextrouſly perform'd, requires no more than a heated Fancy, a bold Front, and a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble Tongue; and therefore an ingenious Author hath told us, That it deſerves much the ſame Commendation that is due to <hi>Extempore</hi>-Verſes; only with this difference, that there is neceſſary to theſe latter, a competent Meaſure of Wit and Learning; whereas the former may be done with very little Wit and no Learning at all. So that the Expediency of Forms of Prayer, which you own in the general, is but little weakned by your unwarrantable Reſtrictions. For if they were found expedient in Times of greateſt Light; and if Men of the greateſt Parts and Abilities have thought it fit and neceſſary to uſe them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch as only talk of great Light, and are vainly conceited of much leſs Abilities, muſt have the greateſt need of them.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee, upon what this Expediency of Forms of Prayer is grounded, and that may help us to ſee more clearly into the Weakneſs and Vanity of the aforeſaid Limitations.</p>
            <p>And (1ſt,) the wiſe Man founds it, on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is between God and us, willing us [<hi>Not to be raſh with our mouth, or haſty to utter any thing before God, becauſe he is in Heaven, and we upon Earth,</hi> Eccleſ. v. 2.] ſhewing that the Reverence we owe to our Maker, ariſing from the Senſe of our Infinite diſtance from him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to beſpeak him in a haſty, looſe, and careleſs manner: Now, this will ſerve for all Times and Perſons, none being ever allowed to vent any thing raſhly or haſtily before him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2dly,) The utter Inability of the beſt of us to perform the Duty of Prayer ſo well, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſudden Conceptions, as by well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31614:20"/>and digeſted Forms, is another ground of the Expediency of them; and this makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for all Perſons in all Times and Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The Diſciples of Chriſt were ſenſible of this, and therefore begg'd our Saviour to teach them to pray: Who thereupon aſſiſted them with a Form: And of this the many Indecencies and Imperfections of thoſe that practiſe otherwiſe, may abundantly convince us.</p>
            <p n="3">(3dly,) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your great Friend and Father Mr. <hi>John Calvin</hi> hath laid down the Expediency of Forms of Prayer, and other Eccleſiaſtical Rites, upon ſuch firm Grounds as will laſt to all Ages; and ſhew the perpetual Uſe and Neceſſity of them: For in his Epiſtle to the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Epiſt. 87.</note> he amply declares his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them, and would have them ſo determined, that it might not be lawful for Miniſters in their Adminiſtrations, to vary from them; and that for theſe Reaſons, partly to be a help to the Weakneſs of ſome, who cannot well perform their Duty without them; partly to put a ſtop to the deſultorious Levity of others, who affect too much, New things; and partly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be a Teſtimony of the Church's Conſent in Doctrine and Worſhip, to future Ages: Now all, or ſome of theſe things will make Forms of Prayer neceſſary and expedient at All Times, and for All Perſons: And conſequently, the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of them, may be aſſerted and eſtabliſhed without your frivolous and groundleſs Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And thus having ſhewn how far we are agreed, about the Lawfulneſs and Expediency of Forms of Prayer; and likewiſe, having endeavoured to remove the little Exceptions which are wont to cereate ſome ſmall difference in both, my next
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31614:21"/>Buſineſs muſt be to conſider, what you offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Injunction of them for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In the mean time, I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have ſeen how far we are agreed about the Lawfulneſs and Expediency of Forms of Prayer: In both which, the difference between us when well conſider'd, is found ſo ſmall; that an honeſt and humble Mind may eaſily yield it, to the Wiſdom and Authority of Superiours, for the ſake of Peace. And that you may be the better perſwaded to this, let us go on to conſider what is further ſaid concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Forms; to ſee how we accord here, that we may the better remove the Miſtakes and Differences that have been raiſed about it.</p>
            <p>And here you tell me, more than once (in your Letter of <hi>June</hi> the 28th) that you are not againſt all impoſing of Forms, upon ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in ſome Caſes. Now this, for ought we know, may prove a pretty comfortable Conceſſion: For it does not utterly diſclaim all Power in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors of ordering and ſetling theſe Matters: And therefore, let us here again inquire, Who are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31614:21"/>the Perſons? And what are the Conditions upon which theſe things may, or may not be impoſed?</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt, for the Perſons, you tell me, that Forms may be impoſed on ſuch as have not the Gift of Prayer; by which you mean, ſuch a Readineſs of Speech as to be able to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. This is ſomething, and I'm glad to find, that you grant Forms of Prayer neceſſary to help the Infirmities, and to ſecure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of publick Worſhip, from the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſuch Men. But how ſhall we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe weak and inſufficient Men from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? For many ignorant and unskilful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are very Opinionative, and apt to think, they can pray as well as the beſt; and many times thoſe are moſt forward to this Exerciſe, who are leaſt able to perform it. For do not ſome ſuffer their Tongues to run this way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear or Wit, to the great Scandal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Profanation of God's Name; who yet are as impatient of Reſtraint as any; and expect the ſame Liberty? And how can this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be remov'd without a general Injunction? But the Perſons on whom you would not have Forms impos'd, are ſuch as have this Gift of Prayer; and are (as you ſay) eminently qualified to pray without them.</p>
            <p>But pray (Sir,) conſider, Are not the beſt and ableſt Men liable to many Infirmities, and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that may marr the Reverence and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of publick Worſhip? Are they not ſubject to many Diſtractions of Mind, and Failures of Memory? May they not be diſturbed with Paſſions, or incumbred with Cares, with many other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that may diſorder their Thoughts, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fruitfulneſs of their Invention? And do not even the beſt of Men ſtand in need of Forms
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31614:22"/>of Prayer, to prevent the bad Effects and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ariſing from theſe things? Is not the Tongue a ſlippery and unruly Member, when let looſe? And apt to run into many Indecencies, and to let fall many unbecoming Expreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are aware? This, ſome of the wiſeſt among you have acknowledged. And is it not much better to tie it up to a Form of ſound Words, than hazard the venting ſo many raſh and indigeſted Ones?</p>
            <p>But 'tis well known (ſay you) <hi>That there are many among us, both Miniſters and People, who have an Ability of fitly expreſſing their Minds unto God in Prayer;</hi> and tho' the Tongue may a little ſlip and faulter now and then, yet why ſhould they be tied up to Forms always, for a few Failings that happen but ſeldom?</p>
            <p>But (Sir,) does it not become the Wiſdom and Authority of the Church, to provide as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible againſt all ſuch Accidents? That which happens ſometimes, may happen often, eſpecially when the Nature of the thing ſo eaſily leads to it: And muſt not the Worſhip of God be ſecured at all times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Indecencies? Beſides, Is it poſſible (think you) for any to expreſs themſelves ſo fitly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſent Conceptions, as they may upon ſecond Thoughts and more mature Deliberation? Can there be that Fulneſs and Comprehenſiveneſs of Matter, that Comlineſs of Order and Method, that Decency and Fitneſs of Expreſſion in an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi>-Prayer, as may be in premeditated and well-digeſted Forms? And (you know) 'tis but reaſon that God ſhould have the beſt. Moreover, 'tis not ſo much a Man's expreſſing his own Mind, that is the Buſineſs of publick Prayer, but his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Minds of others; yea, of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: For the Miniſter is not to preſent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31614:22"/>unto God, only his own private Wants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but the common Needs and Deſires of the People, and the Joint-Devotions of the whole Church: And this will require more than preſent and ſudden Thoughts, to order and offer them up as we ought: So that, theſe things conſidered, your firſt Reſtriction of enjoining Forms of Prayer upon ſome Perſons only, is found to be both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unpracticable.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Let us proceed then to your ſecond Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſee in what Caſes, and upon what Terms, you allow an Injunction of publick Forms?</p>
            <p>And here (tho' it be not ſo plainly laid down) yet we may gueſs a little at it, by your frequent and bitter Complaints, of Two hard Terms in the Injunction of the Liturgy (viz.) (1.) The one is,
<note place="margin">The Uſe.</note> that it requires the Uſe of all that is preſcribed in it (2.) The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, That it requires the Uſe of that and no other.</p>
            <p>Now where is the Hardſhip of theſe Terms? Would you have a Liturgy enjoin'd, without any Obligation of uſing or keeping to it? Or would you have a Liberty granted to every one to alter, amend, or add to it at pleaſure? It ſeems then you can comply with the enjoining a Liturgy, provided that you are not requir'd to uſe all that is contain'd in it, and that you may uſe any other thing beſides it. (That is, in effect) If you may lay aſide what you think fit, and add to it what you pleaſe. And would not this be an admirable Injunction (think you?) But let us examine a little further into this Matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then you complain, <hi>That you are required to uſe all and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by the Book of Common Prayer.</hi> (Sir,) if you would uſe ſo much of it as you well may, and are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31614:23"/>in, this might look like ſomething better than a bare Pretence; and that would bring you on to ſee the Soundneſs and Reaſonableneſs of the reſt: But ſince you lay aſide All, and prefer your preſent Conceptions before any part of it, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that 'tis but an empty Cavil, if not a downright Falſification. And yet to ſhew your great Tenderneſs, I find you talking much (in your Letter of <hi>June</hi> 30th) of ſome Mens brawny Conſciences, and the Wideneſs of their Throats that can ſwallow All, with the Straitneſs of your own, that cannot let down ſo much. But (Sir,) do not ſome [ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel?] <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſtart at an innocent Ceremony or well-compoſed Form, and at the ſame time ſwallow Schiſm, Diviſion, Diſobedience, with many other crying Enormities?</p>
            <p>Again, I find you complaining (in your Letter of <hi>June</hi> 28th) <hi>That you cannot pick and chuſe, and uſe what you think fit, and refuſe the reſt, but muſt (as Travellers on the Kings Highway) keep the Road, and not break out of it, to eſcape any foul way.</hi> (Sir,) there are ſome Creatures ſo apt to wander, that 'tis hard to keep them in the right Way; tho' it be much more ſafe to keep in the ancient Liege-way, than to break out of it. And if you meet with no worſe Paſſages in the publick Roads, than in the publick Prayers, you will have little Cauſe to complain either of foul or rough Ways. But is it fit (think you) for Men to pick and chuſe out of publick Orders and Eſtabliſhments, to obey what they pleaſe, and refuſe the reſt? Is not this to let looſe the Reins, and ſuffer every one to do only what is right in his own Eyes? Is it not ſtrange that any ſhould own or vent ſuch wild Principles of Confuſion?</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:31614:23"/>
            <p>2dly, Secondly, The other hard Term you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of in the Injunction of the Liturgy, is, your being commanded to uſe That and no other. And where's the Hardſhip of this? Would you have the Liturgy enjoin'd, and the uſe of another thing ſet up by its ſide? How can this conſiſt with any Order, or indeed with common Senſe? Or would you have the Liturgy enjoin'd, and the uſe of it left free? This would be to enjoin, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join it, at the ſame time; and can any Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtand upon ſuch a precarious and inconſiſtent Bottom? If a Liturgy, containing all the daily and conſtant Matter of Prayer and Praiſes, together with all the ſtanding Offices of Religion, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd, and no other; it thereby becomes neceſſary to be uſed, and excludes the uſe of any other. And if it be ſo full, as to comprehend all that is needful to thoſe ends, what need is there of any other? Unleſs you think it neceſſary to ask the ſame things every Day in new and varied Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Which can't with any colour of Reaſon be affirmed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Liturgy of the Church, is not ſo ſtrictly enjoin'd, as never to permit the uſe of any other: For in your private and ſecret Devotion, you are at liberty to uſe your free, or compos'd Prayers: And in publick too, upon any new Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or Emergency, other Prayers appointed by Authority, are and ought to be uſed. But for the ordinary and ſtanding Offices of publick Worſhip, as there is no Occaſion, ſo there is no need of any other.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for the further clearing of this Matter, let us ſee the Grounds and Reaſons of this Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And if that make it neceſſary for all Perſons and Occaſions; you will eaſily ſee the weakneſs both of your Complaints and Objections againſt it.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:31614:24"/>
            <p>Now the great Reaſon of enjoining publick Forms, is, as ſundry Acts of Parliament declare, the Uniformity of publick Worſhip; whereby alone, one regular and uniform way of ſerving God, may be preſerv'd among all the Members of a National Church. And this makes it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for all Perſons, Places and Countries, who (according to the Apoſtle's Direction) deſire [<hi>With one mind and one mouth to glorifie their great Creator.</hi>] But I find you with another Brother of yours, often ſtyling this, <hi>That pitiful thing call'd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that never enter'd into the Mind of God or his Son to command.</hi> It ſeems, you can agree well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in a Form of Railing, tho' not of Devotion. But is Uniformity ſuch a Pitiful thing, which alone can help us to ſpeak the ſame things, and to agree in our Petitions, which our Saviour hath made neceſſary to the Succeſs of our Prayers? Is that to be ſo undervalued, that wiſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men have ſo highly prized in all Ages? And will you call that a Pitiful thing, which puts ſuch a Form and Comlineſs into Religious Worſhip, as to render it more prevalent with God, and more pleaſing in the Eyes of Men? Hath not the Wiſdom and Piety of our Governors thought fit to eſtabliſh an Uniformity, ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? And have they employed all this Time, and Care, and Prudence, about a Pitiful thing? Is not this a vile Reflection on our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in Church and State? Can there be an Inſtance of greater Pride, and vain Conceit that ſome have of themſelves? (In a word) does not this plainly ſhew, that Arrogance and Obſtinacy, are the great Vertues and Perfections of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> (ſay you) <hi>in the Matter of Prayer, is ſufficient, without any ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in Words and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31614:24"/>Syllables.</hi> But (Sir,) ſad Experience (which is the beſt Argument) hath taught us, That when the Unity of Forms was by a prevailing Faction, laid aſide, the Unity of the Matter of Prayer, ſoon went with it. For Men fell a praying one againſt another: And when the Pales of the Church were taken away, the groſſeſt Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in point of Doctrine, as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diviſions in point of Worſhip, immediately broke in upon us: The Enemy taking Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſow thoſe Tares that can't be rooted out to this Day. This hath been acknowledged and lamented, by ſome ſober Presbyterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, particularly by Dr. <hi>Tuck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been comprizing the Difference between us, about the Injunction of Forms; by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſonableneſs of enjoyning them on all Perſons and Occaſions for Publick Worſhip: And likewiſe how fit it is, that all the Members of a National Church, for the ſake of Peace, Order and Uniformity, ſhould join in the uſe of them and no other. But becauſe you have ſome Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Authority that thus impoſes them, I muſt endeavour to remove or adjuſt that Matter: For in yours of <hi>June</hi> 28th, you would have me tell you, <hi>Whom we mean by Superiors: And who, or what thoſe Rulers are, that Chriſt hath veſted with ſuch a vaſt Authority, as to command an Invariable Form; and the rather</hi> (you ſay) <hi>becauſe we are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this point among our ſelves; One part of the Diſputers for the Church of</hi> England, <hi>making the King the External Civil Governour; but the Biſhops</hi> the Internal Governours of <hi>the Church, as a Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sir, I know none of the Regular Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> divided in this Point: And I hope to ſhew from the Conceſſions of the moſt eminent Presbyterians, that the Difference between them and us in this Matter, is not ſo great, as is imagined. To this end, let us ſee what Power is lodg'd in the Civil Magiſtrate, about Sacred and Spiritual Things: And what is peculiar to thoſe Spiritual Officers and Miniſters, which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church; and by that means you will ſee plainly, who are thoſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31614:25"/>and Superiors, that may command in theſe Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is a Power in the Church that is purely Spiritual: Such is, That of Preaching the Word, Adminiſtring the Holy Sacraments, the Power of Abſolution, Ordination, Confirmation, Excommunication, and the like. This is the Power of the Keys, committed by Chriſt to the Apoſtles, and in them, to their Succeſſors, the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church. And this Commiſſion is peculiarly directed and confin'd to them; No Civil Magiſtrate having Authority of doing any of theſe Things: For when <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> the King would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the Execution of the Prieſt's Office, we read that it was ſaid to him [<hi>It pertaineth not to thee,</hi> Uzziah, <hi>to burn Incenſe unto the Lord, but to the Prieſts of the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>who are Conſecrated to burn Incenſe.</hi>] 1 Chron. 26.18. Herein (I ſuppoſe) we are all agreed, and I know of none but <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> that affirmed the contrary, who (I think) hath few or no Followers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, There is an External Political Power of Protecting, Ordering, and Well-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church; and this is the Power of the Sword, which is committed to the Civil Magiſtrate only; who is therefore ſaid to be [<hi>The Miniſter of God to us for Good, and an Avenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth Evil.</hi>] Rom. 13.4. And as King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was blam'd for medling with the Power of the Keys, ſo was <hi>Peter</hi> check'd for drawing the Sword; and commanded to put it up, as a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that appertain'd not to him, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.52. Theſe are two diſtinct Powers, the one appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work upon the Inward; the other upon the Outward Man; and both ordain'd by Chriſt, for the edifying and well-ordering of his Church. As for the Miniſters Power, <hi>In Spiritualibus,</hi> (or) the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31614:26"/>due Exerciſe of the Sacred Function, there is no Diſpute: But the Magiſtrate's Power, <hi>Circa Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia, (i. e.)</hi> Whether it extends to Eccleſiaſtical Perſons and Cauſes? is the Knot to be untied. For the clearing whereof, I muſt ſhew, wherein the Civil Magiſtrate's Power in Church-matters, doth mainly conſiſt; that we way ſee, how we agree about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And (Firſt,) The Prince or Civil Magiſtrate, hath a Power of protecting and defending the Church, and every Member of it, in the profeſſion and practice of true Religion. For this end, chiefly, was the Sword put into his Hand; which he is therefore requir'd [<hi>Not to bear in vain,</hi>] Rom. 13.3, 4. but to draw it forth, to the Terror of Evil doers, and the defence of them that do well. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. 'Tis the Magiſtrate's Province and Duty, to maintain the Church in its Rights; and to preſerve it in that fulneſs of Power and Privileges, which Chriſt hath Communicated to it: Hence Kings are ſtil'd [<hi>Nurſing Fathers, and Queens Nurſing Mothers</hi>] to the Church: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.23. And we are bid to pray for them, that under their power and protection, [<hi>We way lead quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>] 1 Tim. 1, 2. <hi>v.</hi> This is granted on all Hands,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, The Prince hath a Power of regulating and well-ordering Matters appertaining to the Church.
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.5, 24.</note> (As) keeping Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Perſons to their reſpective Offices and Duties; preſerving the Places of Publick Worſhip from Sacriledge and Profanation; Eſtabliſhing a Regular and Uniform way of Divine Service to be obſerved in them;
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 31.4.</note> providing and ſecuring a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Maintenace to ſuch as ſerve at the Altar: He may reform the Church when it is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31614:26"/>corrupted in its Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſcipline:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17.</note> Theſe things we find practis'd and commended in all the good Kings both of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> Who took care to remove the Impediments, and encourage the exerciſe of true Religion. Again, Princes may and ought, as Vice-roys of Chriſt's Kingdom, to preſerve the Peace and Unity of the Church; by ſuppreſſing Schiſm, and purging it from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition: To this end, they may guard it with good Laws; and may likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the Eccleſiaſtical Governors to meet in Synods and Convocations, to conſult and agree upon ſuch Canons, as the Neceſſities of the Church ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And becauſe the Power of the Church is wholly Spiritual, and ſome bold Obſtinate Perſons may deſpiſe and ſlight the Cenſures of the Church, which may thereby be render'd ineffectual; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>3dly. Thirdly, The Prince may and ought to ratifie and enforce ſuch wholeſome Laws, by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Sanctions and Penalties, thereby correcting ſuch Diſorderly Members, and puniſhing the Breach and Contempt of Eccleſiaſtical Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. This we find was the practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings and Emperors ever ſince they became Chriſtian: For, when the Church was either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Error, or infeſted by Schiſm, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed their Power to put a Check to ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; and partly by their own imperial Edicts, and partly by the Canons of Councils call'd by their Authority, and enforc'd by Civil Coercions, put a ſtop to the ſpread and increaſe of them. And this is no more than what is neceſſary, for the peace and good Government of the Church: For tho' the Spiritual Rod of Excommunication, hath indeed Terror enough in it, to be dreaded of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31614:27"/>All, that have any ſenſe or care of their Souls, yet becauſe too many are ſo harden'd in their Schiſm and Errors, as not to feel the ſmart of it, <q>The Secular Prince may and ought, to ſecond the Spiritual with the Temporal Rod; to awe ſuch Offenders with Corporal Corrections, as are fearleſs and inſenſible of the Cenſures of the Church.</q> (In a word) becauſe All things in the Church of Chriſt, are required to be done Decently and in Order, therefore Kings and Princes who are the Guardians and
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> Protectors of the Church, are to take care of the Decency and Solemnity of the publick Worſhip perform'd in it: To effect which, they have not only a Directive and Mandatory Power to make Laws and give Rules about it, but likewiſe a Coactive and Compulſory Power to make them obſerv'd: Without which, they can never attain their End All this is granted, by the moſt Eminent Presbyterians, in their <hi>Jus Divinum Regiminis Eccleſiaſtici.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jus Div. c. 9.</note> And the ſame is acknowledg'd likewiſe by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plea for Peace, p. 30, 99.</note> both in his Plea for Peace, and Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Conceſſions are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough for our purpoſe:
<note place="margin">Epiſe. p. 144, 192, 193.</note> For, if Publick Forms of Prayer, have the Authority of Eccleſiaſtical Governours in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be likewiſe ratifyed and enforc'd by the Sanctions of the Civil Power, there can be no juſt exception againſt the Authority that enjoyns them. And you may be ſatisfied from hence, who thoſe Superiors and Rulers are, that may command an invariable Form, which was the thing you queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; and (I hope) is now to your Satisfaction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd. So that, if there be no unlawfulneſs in Forms of Prayer, which you have already granted,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31614:27"/>you may eaſily ſee a ſtrong Obligation lying upon you, to uſe thoſe that are commanded, and no other; which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>But you ask, <hi>What if the King ſhould command one Tranſlation, Verſion, or Form of Prayers, and the Biſhops another, whom muſt we obey?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Sir,) This in our Caſe, is a meer Cavil, becauſe all Authority both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical agree in the preſcribed Forms: And we hope they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Claſh or interfere in that or any other thing for the publick good of Church or State. But if it ſhould ſo happen, (which God forbid) You muſt know, <q>That tho' Chriſt erected a ſtanding Form of Spiritual Government in his Church, yet he never gave any Authority to Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to controul the commanding Power of Princes, in lawful and indifferent Matters:</q> But left all ſuch things intirely to their Diſpoſal and Determination And we never read, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles or Primitive Chriſtians ever claim'd ſuch a Power, or ſuffer'd for diſobeying in ſuch Things.</p>
            <p>There is but one Limitation aſſign'd of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that is [<hi>To obey God rather than Man.</hi>] If the Commands of God and the Prince claſh and contradict each other, there the Prince hath no Right to be obey'd, becauſe his Will is counter-manded by a Superiour Authority. And therefore we find Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who were very tender of giving the leaſt Offence to Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in lawful and indifferent Things, would yet yield no Obedience in things forbidden by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Will of God. This is evident in Matters between God and the King: And 'tis no leſs ſo, in the Caſe between the King and his Subjects; where, if the Spiritual Power of the one, claſh with the Temporal Power of the other, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31614:28"/>which muſt yield; the Inferiour Power being to give place to the Higher Powers: For St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtiles Kings and Emperors, Supream in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: And a Supream (you know) can have no Superiour Power upon Earth to controul or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule him.</p>
            <p>But tho' the King (ſay ſome) be Supream in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affairs, yet there may be and is, a Superiour Power to him in Church-matters.</p>
            <p>This is the Power that is claim'd and uſurp'd by the Pope, over Chriſtian Kings and Emperors. And there are others who are great Enemies to the Pope, that put in their Claim to the ſame Power in theſe Matters; and would fain take it out of his Hands, to put it into their own. But St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (from whom the firſt claim as his Succeſſors,) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerts Kings to be Supream in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; without Limitation or Exception of Spiritual Matters. And what Authority have any to except, where the Spirit of God makes no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? And our Saviour Chriſt, (from whom the latter claim) hath no where limited or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the Sovereign Power of Princes in theſe Things. So that, Kings had need look well to the Rights of their Crown, to preſerve them from the unjuſt Pretenſions and Encroachments of both.</p>
            <p>Beſides, what mad work muſt two Co-ordinate Supremacies make in the ſame Kingdom? For ſince Sacred and Civil Matters are many times ſo cloſeſly twiſted and inter-woven together, that they can hardly be ſeparated or diſtinguiſh'd, what ſharp and unavoidable Conteſts, muſt frequently ariſe about them? And if theſe two Rival-Supreams differ about the extent and limits of their Power, what ſhall the Subject do, who cannot poſſibly obey or pleaſe both? For, ſince no Man can ſerve two
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31614:28"/>Maſters, the ſerving of the One, will be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of the Other; which may draw on him the Diſpleaſure of both. And can it be conceived, that the Great Sovereign of the World, who hath ſtyl'd himſelf, A God of Order, and not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ſhould lay ſuch a Stumbling-block in our way; and leave ſo weighty a Matter, upon which the Peace and Welfare of Kingdoms depend, to ſuch great Uncertainties? Again, if theſe two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-powers fall at variance, who ſhall reconcile them, or what ſhall decide this great Controverſie? Why, nothing upon Earth is able to do it, but the Sword; with which the Spiritual Power hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, for that hath no other Weapons but the Cenſures of the Church, and can only ſtrike with the Thunder of Excommunication; and if theſe be diſ-regarded, as they too often are, it hath nothing left to preſerve or maintain a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. So that, if the Sword be the only Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to defend it, he who is of right intruſted with that, is thereby deſign'd and conſtituted Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thoſe Scriptures</hi> (you ſay) <hi>that require Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Subjection to the Higher Powers, reſpect Church-governours</hi> 300 <hi>Years before the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate appeared in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Sir,) If you conſult Expoſitors, or the Hiſtory of thoſe Times, you will find thoſe Scriptures to reſpect the <hi>Roman</hi> Governors, who then ſway'd the Imperial Sceptre; To whom, our Saviour would have all due Submiſſion and Obedience paid: For he commanded [<hi>To render unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s;</hi>] He acknowledg'd <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Power to be given him from above. And the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians demean'd themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them accordingly. Indeed, for the firſt 300 Years after Chriſt, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Power not only
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31614:29"/>perſecuted but ſought to root out Chriſtianity, the Church was govern'd by its own Laws; and by its own Legiſlative Power, provided the beſt it could, for its own Safety and Edification; but when the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors embrac'd Chriſtianity, to the great Joy of the Chriſtian World, they took the Church into their Care and Protection; which by that means, got out of that heavy Storm of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, under which it had long labour'd; and began to flouriſh in Peace and Proſperity. For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and other Chriſtian Emperors, built Churches for publick Worſhip, and provided for the decent Celebration of it: They conven'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, and often preſided in them, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Canons with their Imperial Edicts, and enforcing them with Temporal Sanctions and Penalties: By which means, the Church is derived down in that happy and flouriſhing State, in which it now continues.</p>
            <p>Thus (Sir,) you ſee, who thoſe Rulers and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors are, that may enjoin an Invariable Form. And I hope, I have in ſome meaſure ſatisfy'd your Demands, and remov'd your Exceptions againſt the Authority that enjoins them.</p>
            <p>But when you have nothing to ſay againſt the Authority of Superiors, you are wont to complain of the Injuſtice and Severity of their Laws, and to cry out of Perſecution, when you ſuffer for the Breach of them; how juſtly this is done, muſt be examin'd in the next. I am</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shew'd in my Laſt, what that Authority is, that lawfully may, and hath enjoin'd Forms of Prayer, together with the Equity and Obligation of thoſe Laws, that require them.</p>
            <p>My next Task muſt be, to inquire into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and Juſtice of thoſe Penalties, that are annext to the Violation of them: And this muſt be the rather done, becauſe I find you talking much of Goals and Impriſonments, and other Hardſhips, which you have endur'd upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: You complain moſt bitterly and frequently of Perſecution, as if you lived under <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and felt all the Tortures that were inflicted on the Primitive Chriſtians, and that for the ſame or as good a Cauſe too; All which is done, merely to derive an Odium upon the Laws and Lawgivers, and to procure the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Pity and Liberty for your ſelves:</p>
            <p>And here I muſt obſerve a double Artifice, which I find you making uſe of, the one to evade the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the other the Penalty of theſe Laws. To effect the</p>
            <p>Firſt, you are wont to call the Injunctions of Superiors not by the Style of Laws or Statutes, which are Terms, that denote and challenge Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but by the odious Name of Impoſitions, that is apt to beget a Diſlike and Abhorrence of them: For though Men are willing to be rul'd and directed, yet they hate to be impos'd upon; and therefore to weaken the Power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he ſhall not be term'd a Lawgiver but an
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31614:30"/>Impoſer, and his Ordinances not Laws but Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that by giving them a bad Name, you may the better ſet them aſide at pleaſure</p>
            <p>But if that will not do, you have another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, to eſcape the Puniſhments of them, and that is by fixing on them the hateful Name of Perſecution; a Term apt to denote more of Cruelty in the Inflictors, than of Guilt in the Sufferers.</p>
            <p>Now, to detect the Fallacy and Falſhood of theſe Arts, 'twill be neceſſary to conſider the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments you thus complain of, together with the Reaſon and Authority upon which they are grounded, that you may the better diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween juſt Puniſhments, and unjuſt Perſecution: And this I ſhall do, as Matters ſtand, before theſe Penalties were ſuſpended, that all Men may ſee the Injuſtice of ſuch Clamours.</p>
            <p>What then are the Puniſhments annex'd to the Laws, that do eſtabliſh Conformity to the Church? Why!</p>
            <p>Theſe are both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil: Of the</p>
            <p>Firſt ſort, are the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Suſpenſion, Deprivation, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which are inflicted by the Authority of the Church, for the Correction and Amendment of Offenders: This is the Power of the Keys committed to the Church by Chriſt himſelf, whereby he hath given Authority to the Biſhops and Paſtors of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting into, and Excluding out of the Church, and thereby of opening and ſhutting the Kingdom of Heaven: Which Power or Commiſſion is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour in theſe Words, <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man, and a Publican: Verily I ſay unto you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> Matt. xviii. 17, 18.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:31614:30"/>
            <p>Now theſe Puniſhments being ordain'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt himſelf, cannot be ſtyl'd Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or made any juſt matter of Complaint when duly inflicted on Offenders. But</p>
            <p>Theſe things (ſay ſome) have been ill manag'd, eſpecially Excommunication, that great Puniſhment, being made too cheap and common; for many have been Excommunicated for Trifles and turn'd out of the Church, for what no Man would be turn'd out of Doors. But</p>
            <p>Sir, Is Obſtinacy and wilful Diſobedience to the Church to be reckoned a Trifle? And yet this is ſtill the chief, if not the only Cauſe of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. He that hearkens to the Church, and ſubmits to the Authority of it, is not to be put out of it, but he that will not, is by our Saviour's Rule, to be accounted no better than a <hi>heathen man, and a Publican:</hi> Neither doth the Smallneſs of the thing extenuate, but rather aggravate the Fault; for the leſs the Matter of the Command is, the greater is the Diſobedience; he that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey in a ſmall thing, will ſooner do it in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And the Reverence of Authority is ſo tender a Matter, and of ſo great Moment, that it muſt not be deſpis'd in either; <hi>For he that heareth you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> Luke x. 16. You know, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty puniſhed the whole Race of Mankind for our firſt Parents taſting the for bidden Fruit, which one would think, was a ſmall Fault for ſo great a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and yet conſidering the Ingratitude, the Stubborneſs and Diſobedience involved in it, 'twas a crying Enormity, and juſtly deſerved that Vengeance that was inflicted: I ſhall leave you to apply it, and proceed,</p>
            <p>2dly, To the Civil Puniſhments annexed to the Violation of theſe Laws; and theſe are ſo eaſie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31614:31"/>and gentle, that none have any need to cry out of Perſecution, or to brand the Magiſtrate for a Tyrant or Perſecutor in inflicting of them: For is not Twelve-pence a <hi>Sunday</hi> a moderate Fine for abſenting from the publick Aſſemblies? And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Mens own Wilfulneſs and Obſtinacy can draw upon them the higher Fines, or the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Impriſonment, which were thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to awaken and reform ſome ſtubborn Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
            <p>Our Laws have no Capital or Sanguinary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in Matters of Religion, nor do they allow any to be put to Death, or to be cruelly tormented for them, but only by moderate Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties compell them to hear Inſtruction, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from propagating their Errors and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to the Diſturbance of the Peace of the Church and State. And yet you make as loud Outcries and Complaints of Perſecution for theſe things, as if with ſome of the Ancient Martyrs you were to be broke upon the Wheel, and with St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> to be roaſted upon the Gridiron.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee the Difference between Legal Puniſhments and Perſecution, theſe muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſhed; for elſe the Thief and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and all other Offenders, may cry out of Perſecution for ſuffering the juſt Puniſhments of their Crimes.</p>
            <p>In Perſecution then Two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cauſe and the Meaſure of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. For to ſuffer without a Cauſe, and to be puniſhed for the Breach of a Law, which neither hath nor can be prov'd, is a ſort of Perſecution; and ſuch likewiſe is that, where the Puniſhment exceeds the Deſign of the Law, or the Demerit of the Crime.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:31614:31"/>
            <p>But the proper Notion of Perſecution is to ſuffer for a good Cauſe, that is, for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake: To be brought before Magiſtrates, and hal'd away to Priſons and Death it ſelf for the Name of Chriſt, and adhereing to his Truth. This was the Caſe of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, who were therefore ſaid to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. In this Caſe our Saviour's Direction was, <hi>Either to fly where it might be, or patiently and chearfully to ſuffer, where it could not;</hi> ſo that my mentioning your Removal into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was no worſe Advice than Chriſt gave to his own Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that is, <hi>If they were perſecuted in one place, to flee to another;</hi> and if <hi>England</hi> were ſuch a hot Furnace of Perſecution, as you repreſent it, 'twas no bad Counſel to move into the more Northern and cooler Regions of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Air and the Religion of the Climate may be the more agreeable with the due Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Diſſenters: But this by the by.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Cauſe then, and not the Suffering that makes the Martyr: In like manner, 'tis not the undergoing of Puniſhment, but the ſuffering for Chriſt, and for Righteouſneſs ſake, that makes the Perſecution: <hi>For what glory is it,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye ſhall take it patiently? But if when ye do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 20. Now the Sufferings you complain of, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Chriſt, nor for Righteouſneſs ſake; for you may be as Righteous, and ſerve Chriſt as well, yea, I think much better within the Church, than out of it; and to ſuffer for the Breach of good Laws, made for the Preſervation of Peace and good Order in the Church of Chriſt, and to guard the Worſhip of God from the Rudeneſs and Irreverence of Sectaries and Schiſmaticks, is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31614:32"/>to ſuffer as an evil Doer, and the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors may as well complain of their Sufferings, as any other in ſuch Caſes: Such Sufferings can give none any Comfort here, nor intitle them to any Reward hereafter; yea, they are rather the Beginnings of Sorrows, and the Fore runners of future and far grater Puniſhments. Indeed the Impatience you betray under them, ſhews them to be founded on a bad Bottom, and that you do not expect from them the Crown of Martyſdom; for elſe you might with the Apoſtles rejoice in your Sufferings, and inſtead of complaining, thank God, that you are accounted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt; we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from being afraid or aſham'd, that he gloried in the Croſs, and when ſome lamented his hard Fate in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he checked their Tears, and told them, <hi>That he was ready not only to be bound, but to die for the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Acts xxi. 13.</p>
            <p>Whereas your frequent Outcries and Complaints of Sufferings do betray your Guilt, and ſhew, That you can take no comfort in them; and to tell you truly, to ſuffer for a fond Adherence to <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer, ſhews only a Zeal without Knowledge, and he that loſes his Livelyhood for an obſtinate Refuſal of wholſome Forms, does but fall a Sacrifice to his own Raſhneſs and Folly.</p>
            <p>But whilſt you make ſuch heavy Complaints of eaſie and juſt Puniſhments, deſign'd merely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the publick Peace, and to reform your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Errors, you may do well to call to mind the far greater and more unjuſt Sufferings, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the time of the great Rebellion, and that not for the Breach, but Obſervance of good Laws, and a firm Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Duty both to God and the King:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31614:32"/>What miſerable Outrage and Violence was offer'd to their Perſons? What Rapine, Plunder, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and Spoil was made of their Goods and Eſtates? And having nick-nam'd them, Malignants, there were no Cruelties too great to be executed upon them: 'Twere too long, and too ſad a Story to relate the doleful Tragedies acted upon the Prince, Peers, and People, and how the Three Kingdoms groan'd under the direful Effects of an outragious and intemperate Zeal.</p>
            <p>But becauſe you may read theſe things in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Authors, and particularly in a Book called <hi>Angliae Ruina,</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Ruſticus,</hi> I ſhall add no more on this ſad Subject, but ſhall refer you to them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort then, you will do well to conſider the Cauſe of the Sufferings you complain of, and if it cannot ſtand the Tryal of Reaſon now, you may well think, it will much leſs bear the ſeverer Tryal of the laſt Day; if they are found to be the juſt and neceſſary Penalties of good Laws, do not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your ſelf with the Name or Reward of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but rather make a right uſe of them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to your Duty both to God and the Church, that you may avoid unneceſſary Troubles here, and far greater Dangers and Puniſhments hereafter.</p>
            <p>But you have two or three Pleas more to ſhift off Obedience to good Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> a Judgment of Diſcretion or Plea of Conſcience, the Plea of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Plea of Toleration, all which ſhall be conſider'd in Order. In the mean time, I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Conſider'd in my Laſt your Plea of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby you have endeavour'd to evade the juſt and neceſſary Puniſhments of wholſome Laws.</p>
            <p>I come now to another Plea, by which you ſeek to caſt off all Obedience to them, and that is your Judgment of Diſcretion, whereby you can very diſcreetly judge any thing to be unlawful, which you have no mind to obey: And this Judgment, though never ſo falſe, ill grounded, and erroneous, ſhall give you a Superſedeas, and juſtifie your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to them; this is a Matter of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it ought to be well examin'd in order to the Peace of Church and State.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee then where this Judgment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is lodg'd, and how 'tis managed in order to the compaſſing of this end.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe, pray conſult your Letter of <hi>June</hi> the 23th, where you will find theſe Words: <hi>I ſee you lodge the final Deciſion of what is lawful, decent, and expedient in theſe Matters, in the Breaſts of Superiours;</hi> Yes, Sir, in all things that are not apparently unlawful, indecent, and inexpedient; For ſince, ſome-body muſt have the determining of theſe things, I know not where this Power can be more ſafely lodg'd. But you go on, and ſay, Indeed if it be in a thing confeſs'd indifferent, the Judgment is readily allow'd to the Superiors; but if the Queſtion be about lawful and unlawful, we muſt have a Judgment of Diſcretion allow'd us as to our Practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where 'tis obvious to obſerve,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31614:33"/>how all Power of judging in the publick Affairs of Church and State, is wreſted out of the hands of of the Superiors, and cunningly lodg'd in the Breaſts of the People. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, a thing muſt be <hi>confeſs'd</hi> to be indifferent, before the Magiſtrate ſhall be allow'd to have any Judgment at all in it: Now Men that have any Intereſt to the contrary, will confeſs no more things to be indifferent, than they have a Mind to, as appears in the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, which tho' in their own Nature plainly indifferent, yet ſome Men cannot or will not think them ſo, becauſe they do not think fit to obſerve them; yea, they have a farther fetch, if the Indifferency of them too plainly appear, and that is, that the impoſing of them alters their Nature, and makes them neceſſary, and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, by which Artifice their Judgment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſhall rob the Magiſtrate of all Judgment and Authority in indifferent things. Then</p>
            <p>2dly, <hi>If the Queſtion</hi> (ſay you) <hi>be about lawful or unlawful, then every one muſt have a Judgment of Diſcretion allowed them of Courſe:</hi> So that by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Magiſtrate is cut off from all Judgment of Diſcretion here too, and the final Deciſion of what is lawful, decent, and expedient, is wholly lodg'd in the Breaſt of the Subject; which is an excellent way to ſet them above their Superiors, and to ſhift off all Obedience to them:</p>
            <p>Yea, this hath mounted you to that degree of Arrogance, as to queſtion whether you have any Superiors in theſe Matters; for you ask in the fore-cited Letter, who thoſe Superiors are, that have this Authority of enjoining Forms of Prayer? Whether it be the King or the Biſhops? Sir,</p>
            <p>There are none ſo blind as thoſe that will not ſee; this pretended Ignorance of yours, is not ſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31614:34"/>much in Favour to the King, from whom your Principles take away the Eccleſiaſtical Power, as Spleen to the Biſhops, whom you would likewiſe deprive of it: You cannot tell where the Power lies, becauſe you have no mind to obey it, elſe you might eaſily know, that tho' the Biſhops and Prieſts have an Epiſcopal and Paſtoral Office which they derive from Chriſt, yet they order and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh nothing about the publick Exerciſe of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent and Authority of the King, whom they own Supream in Eccleſiaſtical as well as Civil Matters; ſo that this Objection proceeds not from a real but affected Ignorance; and let the Power be where it will, if it meddle with the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, your Judgment of Diſcretion well manag'd, can take it out of the hands of both.</p>
            <p>Thus you lodge all deciſive Judgment about theſe things, in the Hands and Breaſts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſo they may, at their Diſcretion, ſit in Judgment upon their Sovereign, and from cutting off his Power, may proceed to cut off his Head too, of which our unhappy Age hath afforded a Doleful and Tragical Inſtance; ſo that Princes had need to look well to this Judgment of Diſcretion, if they mean to ſecure either their Laws or their Lives.</p>
            <p>Now to remedy theſe Evils, and to learn our Duty in theſe Matters, let us have Recourſe to the Holy Scriptures, and there we are bid to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the King as Supream, and to Governors as thoſe that are ſent by him,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. where the Supremacy of the King, and the Subordination of inferior Governors to him is plainly aſſerted, which Supremacy makes the King the Fountain and Springhead of all Power in his Dominions, from whence all others derive it, and conſequently the final Determination of publick Affairs muſt be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31614:34"/>thereby lodged in him: And therefore in the ſame place we are bid to ſubmit to every Ordinance of Man, that is not contrary to any Ordinance of God. The Apoſtle's directions to know them that are over us in the Lord, wills us ſo to know them, as to look upon them as Gods Anointed and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents upon Earth, to reverence their Perſions, and obey their Laws, being both ſtamp'd with a Divine Authority, and this will diſpoſe us to pay a due Deference to their Judgments, and to yield a juſt Reſpect to their greater Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>This Leſſon Chriſtian Modeſty it ſelf teaches; for that wills us to have low and mean Thoughts of our ſelves, and to think others better and wiſer than our ſelves, eſpecially our Governors, who have far greater Advantages and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of knowing more than we can; and being ſo much above us in Place and Power, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſed to ſee farther into things, than our lower Station will admit of: And therefore 'twill become us to think ſoberly of our ſelves, to ſuſpect our own Judgment, when it croſſes theirs, and ſubmit our private to the publick Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>But will not theſe (ſay you) make us turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and reduce us to a blind Obedience? No, far from it: For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffers not its Followers to examine their Doctrins, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into their Injunctions, but exacts an implicit Faith to the one, and a blind Obedience to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It ſtiles <hi>Ignorance the Mother of Devotion,</hi> and ſeeks by all means to keep People in it, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Scriptures in an unknown Tongue, and keeping from them the Key of Knowledge: In a word, it makes them pin their Faith on the Prieſts Sleeves, and to put out their own Eyes, that they may ſee the better with his; whereas
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31614:35"/>the Church of <hi>England</hi> not only allows, but wills all Men to try the foundneſs of its Doctrin, and the lawfulneſs of its Commands by the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of God's Word: To that end, the Holy Scriptures are daily read and unfolded unto them; we care not how much Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our People have, ſo they be but Modeſt and Humble with it, willing to learn, and to pay a due regard and deference to their Teachers; that they do not oppoſe and diſturb Government, by a too obſtinate adhereing to their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſubmit to the Wiſdom and Authority of Superiors, being content that they ſhould know more, and to be directed by them; without this no Government can ſtand, nor any Peace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be maintained: Neither is it ſo abſurd (as ſome imagine) for the Common People in a great meaſure to truſt their lawful Paſtors and Maſters in things wherein they are not ſo compleat Judges of themſelves.</p>
            <p>But they (ſay you) may juſtly challenge a Right to judge what is Sin, that are like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for it if they do ſin.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, will give all People a Right to make and judge of Laws, becauſe they are to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for breaking them: But I think 'tis a much ſafer courſe for them to rely on the Wiſdom of Superiors, than to truſt too much to their own weaker Judgment in theſe Matters; for they are many times too ignorant to judge what is fit to be done or not done, as we may ſee in the caſe of Schiſm, or breach of Communion, which too many live in without any Senſe of the Fault, or Remorſe for it, and ſo are in danger of being condemned for a Sin which they will not judge to be ſo.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:31614:35"/>
            <p>But Governors (ſay you) are not infallible, and general Counſels may err; Very true! But are not the Common People more liable and likely to err than they? Hath not that been ever thought moſt credible and fitteſt to be hearkened to, which is approved by the beſt and wiſeſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
            <p>And is it not moſt fit, That their Judgment ſhould determine and over-rule the reſt? Does not <hi>Solomon</hi> tell us, That he that leans to his own Underſtanding, or which is all one, he that will truſt to his own judgment of Diſcretion is a Fool? And certainly, he muſt be extreamly wiſe in his own Conceit, that will ſet up his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above all that are above him, and think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wiſer than all the Wiſdom of a Nation.</p>
            <p>But you add, That Superiors, if the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe Matters lodges in them, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in the wrong: And will the People (think you) if they have the Power, be always in the right? Are not theſe much more prone to Errors and Miſtakes than the others? And is it not far more ſafe to truſt the Judgment of wiſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and able Perſons, than to follow the rude, heady, and illiterate Vulgar?</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then, 'tis evidently the Duty of Subjects and Inferiors, not to lean too much to their own Judgment, much leſs to ſet it up againſt well eſtabliſh'd Laws, to evade Obedience to them: A Parent you know, or Maſter will not ſuffer his Children or Servants to be govern'd by their own Diſcretion, but his, and when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands any thing to be done, or left undone, will not allow him to diſpute his Commands, or oppoſe their own Senſe or Judgment as a Reaſon for their Diſobedience. Now 'tis but to pay the ſame Duty and Reſpect to your Superiors in Church

            <p>But will not this (ſay you) require Obedience to Arian, Popiſh and Presbyterian Governors, when they happen to be uppermoſt? And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place you tell me, that this Doctrin would have done ſpecial Service in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, and will bear a Man's Charges through all the Turks Dominions. Sir, in what Country or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Governors ſoever we ſhall happen to live, we are oblig'd in Conſcience, to obey the ſupream Authority of it in all lawful Things. For Power being the Ordinance of God, extends to all ſuch Things as are not countermanded by God himſelf; but if they command any thing that is unlawful or forbidden, we are not bound to yeild Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yea we are bound not to yeild it, becauſe we are to obey God rather then Man, when their Commands happen to claſh or interfere: But then the thing muſt be plainly and evidently forbidden by ſome expreſs Law of God, before we can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our Obedience; for if the thing commanded be but doubtful or diſputable, if the ſinfulneſs of it doth not manifeſtly appear, but depends only on ſome remote, uncertain, and far fetch'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31614:36"/>if more and wiſer Men judge it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than unlawful; here in ſuch doubtful Matters, which is our preſent Caſe, the Authority of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors ought to over-rule our weaker Judgments, and we muſt ſubmit our private to the publick Wiſdom; and if we are at any time miſled this way, it will not be ours, but the Superiors Fault, and if it be not in a Matter apparently ſinful; 'twill never be charg'd on us, but thoſe who have the Command and Conduct of us. But how come they thus boldly to challenge a Judgment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, who, when time was, denied it to all others, tho' they put in the ſame Claim to it? Are you, Sir, the only Men of Diſcretion, to whom all others muſt ſubmit? And muſt none be allowed any Judgment of it but your ſelves? This is a farther Inſtance of your abominable Pride and Partiality.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this and your Plea of Conſcience is mightily inſiſted on, as the main Diſpenſations from Obedience, 'twill be requiſite to give ſome farther Account of it, which ſhall be done in my next. In the mean time, I am</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Conſider'd in my laſt your Judgment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and ſhew'd how far it ought to ſtoop to the Judgment and Diſcretion of Superiors. But becauſe this, and the Pretence of Conſcience (which is indeed but the ſame Plea) is commonly alledg'd to take off Obedience to Laws, and is by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, thought a good Diſpenſation from it, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give ſome further Account of it. To which end, I muſt enquire into the Nature and Rule of Conſcience, and ſhew, when it is a good Rule to guide our Actions, and when not: To which I ſhall add ſome things touching an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, doubting, and ſcrupulous Conſcience.</p>
            <p>1ſt. And Firſt, For the Nature of Conſcience; It is nothing elſe but a Man's Mind or Judgment, concerning the Good or Evil, the Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of things; and according as the Mind is well, or ill inſtructed or perſwaded of them, ſo it is either a good or bad Conſcience. Now the Rule of Conſcience is the Will of God, made known either by the Light of Nature, or plain Scripture, or by direct Conſequence and Deductions from it; for God being the ſole Lawgiver and Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he alone hath the Right to govern and direct it, which he doth by all, or ſome of theſe Ways. By which we may learn</p>
            <p>2dly, When Conſcience is a ſafe Rule to guide our Actions, and when not; and this is the more carefully to be minded, becauſe very bad things have been done by miſguided Conſciences: We read of ſome who in killing the Apoſtles, thought
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31614:37"/>they did God good Service; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Church, did it, as himſelf declares, in all good Conſcience; for, he verily thought that he ought to do many things againſt the Name of Chriſt; and 'tis well known what vile things have been acted under the Mask of a real or pretended Conſcience. And therefore it muſt be duly regulated, before it can ſafely direct, or juſtifie our Actions; and how is that? Why thus, when it is well informed out of God's Word, and paſſeth a right Judgment on things, then 'tis a good Guide, and leads us in the way that we ſhould go. But when 'tis ill advis'd, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains wrong Notions, then 'tis a blind and falſe Guide, and leads into Bogs and Errors; in which laſt Senſe, 'tis not ſo properly ſtil'd Conſcience, as Humour, Fancy, and Miſtaken Opinion.</p>
            <p>For the better clearing hereof, we muſt note further, That there are ſome things which the Law of God hath made neceſſary by commanding them, and there are other things which it hath made ſinful by for bidding them: And beſides theſe, there are ſome things of a middle and indifferent Nature, which God hath neither commanded nor forbidden. In the two former ſort of things, our Conſciences are tied up, by a direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Obligation laid on them by God himſelf; for we cannot omit any thing which God hath commanded, neither can we commit any thing which he hath forbidden, without apparent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him; but in the things of a middle and indifferent Nature, which are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor forbidden, our Conſcience is at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and may be no further reſtrained, than by the Rules of Obedience to Governours, for the publick Good, or as we ſhall think fit, by the Rule of Prudence and Charity to reſtrain our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31614:38"/>ſelves: So that, in theſe indifferent things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Power of the Magiſtrate chiefly lies, we may be reſtrained by Humane Laws, made for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Church and State, to the Obſervance whereof our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are tied up, not by a direct and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Obligation, as in the former things; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily and mediately by Virtue of a Command of God, requiring us to obey Magiſtrates, and to ſubmit to every <hi>Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake:</hi> And being thus oblig'd to obey them for Conſcience ſake, 'twill be abſurd to make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a Plea for diſobeying them.</p>
            <p>Now when the Mind is thus enligtned from God's Word, and fully perſwaded of the Truth of theſe things, taking things commanded for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and things forbidden for ſinful, and thoſe that are neither the one nor the other, for things indifferent; in which we are free any further than we are preſcribed to by our Superiors, to whom we owe Obedience, as God's Miniſters and Viceroys upon Earth: When I ſay, the Mind is thus rightly informed in theſe Matters, 'tis a good, firm, and well-grounded Conſcience, and is a ſafe Rule and Guide of our Actions; and this is a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and found Temper of Mind.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, when the Mind is ill inform'd and unſetled, taking things lawful for unlawful, and unlawful things for lawful, abſtaining from ſome things as ſinful, which God hath no where forbidden, as Forms of Prayer, and doing other things, with an Opinion of Holineſs and Neceſſity, which God hath no where required, as <hi>Extempore</hi> and varied Prayers. This is an entangled and perplexed Conſcience, and it is a very uncertain and unſafe Guide of our Actions, inſomuch, That to be acted by it, is not to be led by any found
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31614:38"/>Principles of Duty and Conſcience, but by the wrong Meaſures of Fancy, Humour, and Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Opinion; and this is a very ſickly, weak, and unſound State of Mind: Which will lead me to the Conſideration of an Erroneous, Doubting, and Scrupulous Conſcience, the three grievous Diſeaſes and Infirmities of the Mind, and to ſhew how we may be beſt cur'd and rid of them.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, an erroneous Conſcience is, when a thing in it ſelf lawful, and enjoin'd by lawful Authority, ſhall be judged ſinful, and unlawful to be done; and likewiſe, when a thing in its own Nature ſinful, and forbidden by lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhall yet be judg'd not only lawful, but neceſſary to be done: This is an erring Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and brings a Man into very great Straits; for he lies under a Neceſſity of ſinning, let him go which Way he will: If he does the thing which he judges unlawful, he acts againſt the Perſwaſion of his own Mind, and ſo being <hi>not of Faith is Sin;</hi> If he refuſe the doing of it, he acts againſt lawful Authority, and ſins in diſobeying that Power in a thing which he is commanded to obey. As in the former Inſtance, If any ſhall judge a Form of Prayer, enjoin'd by Superiors, to be unlawful; here, if he uſes it, he ſins againſt the Duty he owes to his own Conſcience; if he uſes it not, he ſins againſt the Duty he owes to his lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; both ways he commits a grievous Sin, which he cannot avoid, whilſt he continues in his Error. This is indeed a great and grievous Snare, and where a Man is really intangled with it; and in good earneſt, he deſerves Pity.</p>
            <p>Now, To get rid of it, becauſe our Mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter the Nature of things, we muſt endeavour to alter our Mind, and bring it rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Nature of things; to which end, we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31614:39"/>muſt bring humble and teachable Minds free from Pride, Paſſion, and all manner of Prejudice; not miſled by Intereſt, Humour, or vain Conceit; but willing to learn and receive Satisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulting our lawful <hi>Paſtors,</hi> or ſome other able <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> that may be able and willing to direct us; weighing the Arguments on the ſide of Authority, as well as thoſe againſt it, uſing as much of the preſcribed Forms as we lawfully may, and going with Authority as far as we can: If this were heartily and ſincerely done, there would be few Separatiſts or Diſſenters; for Satisfaction, this way might ſoon be had, and wherein any were otherwiſe minded, God would ſoon reveal even this unto him.</p>
            <p>2dly, A Doubting Conſcience is, when the Mind is in ſuſpence about the Lawfulneſs or Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a thing, and hangs as it were in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> having Arguments ſometimes perſwading it one way, and ſometimes another, ſo that 'tis at a loſs which way to incline: In this Caſe, if the Matter in Queſtion be a thing enjoined by Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, 'tis very reaſonable that Authority ſhould turn the Scale, and that, laying aſide the Doubt, we ſhould do the thing commanded.</p>
            <p>For in doubtful Matters, the ſafeſt Courſe is to be taken: Now ſince the Duty of Obedience is certain, and the particular Matter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand only doubtful, Reaſon wills, That we chuſe a Certainty before an Uncertainty; and therefore, in ſuch Caſes, the Judgment and Authority of Superiours muſt over-rule, and a certain Duty take place of an uncertain Doubt.</p>
            <p>This cannot be ſaid to be acting againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for here the Mind being in ſuſpence, and having not determined, or paſs'd Sentence either way, it cannot be ſaid to be more againſt the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31614:39"/>Conſcience than with it, and the weight of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt be eſteemed very light, if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry it in ſuch a Caſe;</p>
            <p>So that if any do but doubt of the Lawfulneſs or Expediency of Preſcribed Forms, the Injunction of them ought to diſcard thoſe Doubts and oblige them to join in the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>But, does not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>He that doubteth is damned, if he eat?</hi> Yes, he that doth a thing doubtingly, wherein he is under no Command, but is left free and arbitrary to himſelf; as in the Caſe of eating, mentioned by the Apoſtle, juſtly incurs the Peril of Damnation, becauſe he acts againſt his Conſcience in a thing wherein he ought to be guided by it. But if a thing be determin'd by Authority, of the Lawfulneſs whereof a Man is not fully perſwaded, but hath only ſome Doubts about it; he may, and ought to guide his Doubts, and do as he is commanded without any danger of Damnation; for if he do amiſs in it, 'twill be a Fault of the Governors who required it, and not his, whoſe Duty it is, in ſuch Caſes, to obey.</p>
            <p>3dly, A Scrupulous Conſcience is, when the Mind is pretty well ſatisfied about the Lawfulneſs of a thing, and yet hath ſome ſlight Fears and Scruples about it: This is a crazy and weak tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, proceeding from Melancholy, or too great Timorouſneſs occaſioned by reading ſome ſort of Books, and converſing with ſome ill inſtructed Perſons, which are apt to ſuggeſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fears and Objections: And this I take to come neareſt to your Caſe; for tho' you are reaſonably well perſwaded of the Lawfulneſs of Forms of Prayer in general, and of ours in particular, yet you entertain your ſelf, and feed others with ſome unreaſonable Jealouſies and Scruples about

            <p>No. Sir, being pretty will ſatisfied in the Main, if you can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> otherwiſe get rid of theſe Scruples, 'twill be your Duty and Wiſdom too to throw them clear off, as the Snares and Temptations of the Devil, and to comply with decent and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conſtitutions, without minding the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and Importunity of them; for if greater Doubts ought to give place to the Wiſdom and Authority of Governours, certainly ſuch little Scruples ought not to ſtand in Competition with them.</p>
            <p>But the 14th Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſay you, if well minded, would put an end to theſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; and indeed ſo it would, if it were well underſtood and obſerved: For the things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of in that Chapter, were things not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent in their Nature, but left ſo as to their Uſe, as the eating of Herbs, and ſundry ſorts of Meat, the obſerving of Days, and the like; in which, every one had their Liberty, no Superior Power having interpos'd, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or forbid them; in which Caſe, they ſinned not in uſing, or auſtaining from them: And therefore the Apoſtle wills them, <hi>not to cenſure, or condemn one another,</hi> for uſing this Liberty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe with us is very different; for, tho' the things are indifferent in themſelves, and left ſo, as to our Judgment about them, yet our Practice is determined by the Authority of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31614:41"/>which are to ſway and over-rule in theſe Matters.</p>
            <p>There are indeed, many things left arbitrary and indifferent to us, about which, Men may, and do entertain ſome Scruples; as playing at Cards, and Dice, lending upon Uſury, and the like; which being under no Command, Men may do in them, as they think moſt convenient. Here the Caſe is parallel with us and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all the Apoſtle's Directions about the one, may well enough be applied to the other.</p>
            <p>But as for Forms of Prayer, Kneeling at the Sacrament, and the like: Theſe being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Superiors for the Decency and Order of Publick Worſhip, it becomes our Duty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and our Sin to neglect, or act contrary to them.</p>
            <p>And thus having, I hope, given you ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as to the Plea of Conſcience and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion, I ſhall next conſider your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Moderation. In the mean time, I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have ſeen, That neither the Judgment of Diſcretion, or Plea of Conſcience, can null the Obligation, or diſpenſe with our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the wholſome Laws either of Church or State.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee then what your Notion of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can do towards it, whether that will not take off ſome part of them, or allow us to obſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much of them as we think fit: For 'tis not for nothing that you ſo frequently cry up Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is a plauſible Term for ſome Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You talk much of a due Temper towards Diſſenters, by which you mean (no doubt) the indulging 'em in their Schiſms and Diviſions: And to draw in ſome Church-men of your ſide, you often commend ſuch as fail and falter in their Duty, for moderate Men.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the Apoſtle wills,
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.5.</note> That <hi>Our Moderation ſhould be known unto all Men,</hi> 'twill be requiſite to inquire into the Nature and true Notion of that Vertue, that we may rightly know our ſelves what we are to make known unto others. To this end, we muſt Note,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Moderation is ſometimes taken for the moderate uſe of God's Creatures, or keeping the mean in Eating or Drinking; in this Senſe 'tis the ſame with Temperance and Sobriety, which help to regulate our Appetite and Practice in the neceſſary Actions and Refreſhments of humane Life. But tho' this be an excellent and uſeful Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31614:42"/>yet it falls not under our preſent Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Moderation is ſometimes taken for the well-governing our Paſſions and Affections, keeping them within their due Bounds, and not ſuffering 'em to run into Inordinacy or Exceſs; In this Senſe 'tis the ſame with Meekneſs or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, which teach Men to moderate their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and regulate all other Paſſions by fixing 'em upon right Objects, and keeping 'em within their due Meaſures and Proportions. This likewiſe is an excellent Vertue, and highly conduces both to the publick and private Peace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Moderation is ſometimes taken for the mild-interpreting and executing of Laws, Conſtruing 'em in the more favourable Senſe, and abating the Rigour and Severity of them,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Summum jus ſumma injuria.</hi>
               </note> which in many Caſes would be great Injury and Oppreſſion. In this Senſe, 'tis the ſame with Equity, which takes off the edge and extremity of Laws, and gives all thoſe Allowances which are conſiſtent with the Reaſon and Intention of them; this too is a great Vertue and Neceſſary to the Welfare and good Government of all Societies.</p>
            <p>Theſe I take to be the principal, if not the only approved Senſes of Moderation. But beſides theſe, ſome have lately ſtarted a new and wild Notion of it, that was never heard of in the Church, till the Riſe of our unhappy Schiſms and Diſſenſions: Since which, ſome have taken Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a paring off a great part of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Church, and complying too far with the Diſſenters from it.</p>
            <p>Thus, he that prevaricates and performs his Duty by halves, by curtailing and cutting ſhort the Prayers of the Church, mangling and leaving
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31614:43"/>out what parts he pleaſes of them in the publick Miniſtrations: He that Baptizeth without the Sign of the Croſs, and many times neglects the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Habits and Geſtures appointed to be uſed in Divine Service, ſuch an one is ſtiled, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently paſſes for a moderate Man; and ſuch as theſe are the Darlings of the Diſſenters, for we ſhall hear them commending their Moderation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions: The plain Reaſon whereof is, becauſe they do juſt as they would have them, that is, by neglecting ſome part of their Duty to the Church, they give 'em ſome Countenance in rejecting all; Yea, they take theſe half Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to be inward Approvers of their ways, they think and ſay that their Hearts are with 'em, and would gladly come to 'em, were it not for ſome Advantages and Preferments in the Church that keep 'em from 'em. Now this, beſides the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs and Hypocriſie of the Conformity, is a moſt dangerous piece of Moderation, for it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Diſſenters in their Schiſm, betrays the Church, and lays it open to the Aſſaults and Evil Deſigns of its greateſt Enemies.</p>
            <p>Again, he that Conforms to the Diſſenters in long Pulpit-Prayers before Sermon, haſtily run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over the Prayers of the Church to make more room for his long-winded Conceptions, he goes for a moderate Man, and many ſuch (you tell me) there are in the Church, with whom you have ſome Acquaintance, and for whom you have no ſmall Honour.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope, the number of thoſe Men are not ſo great as you imagine; I am ſure the Church gives 'em no leave, or encouragement for any ſuch Practice, for this wills us in our Pulpit-Prayers to uſe either thoſe Conciſe Words men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Canon, or ſome ſhort form of our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31614:43"/>own to the ſame effect. And the ancient practice of the Church was according to it, for we find the Fathers before their Sermons had only ſome <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ota pacis,</hi> or Benedictions of the People, or ſome ſhort Ejaculations imploring the Divine Aſſiſtance, as we ſee in the Homilies of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine, &amp;c.</hi> Where you will find either a ſhort Collect, or Form of Prayer us'd without variation, or elſe only an invitation to Prayer, like the Bidding Prayer mention'd in the Canon: Yea, your great Friend Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed one ſhort Form before Sermon, which concluded ſtill with the Lord's Prayer, as you may find it recorded in the Hiſtory of his Life.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when our Liturgy is ſo well ſtor'd with Divine and Heavenly Prayers ſuited to all neceſſary Occaſions, and when we have ſpent near an hour in offering 'em up unto God, for all that can be thought fit for Chriſtians to pray for, what need can there be for beginning a new Harrangue in the Pulpit for the ſame things, or making a freſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in varied Phraſes for them, unleſs we think that God is either to be overcome with the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, or charm'd with the Novelty of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in both which we entertain low and unworthy thoughts of him.</p>
            <p>Yea, this is not only a needleſs, but very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Practice, and has done the Church great harm; for this ſlight perfunctory way of reading the Prayers has occaſion'd the Contempt of 'em, and put People in love with varied <hi>Extempore</hi> Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which tho' not half ſo ſound either for Matter or Senſe, are yet recommended to them by a more affectionate Delivery, inſomuch as when they behold the Miniſter cold, dull and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the Desk, and all Life and Flame in the Pulpit, they begin to think meanly of the ſaint,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31614:44"/>languid Devotion of the one, and are wholly taken up with the ſeeming Earneſtneſs and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the other.</p>
            <p>And this has been one great Occaſion of that giddineſs and inſtability in Religion, which is the pernicious Malady and Miſery of our preſent Age; Theſe, with many other ſad and doleful Evils, too many to be here reckon'd up, are the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Effects of this falſe Notion of Moderation, which you highly Extol and Commend in ſome Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, there's a piece of <hi>Moderation</hi> in the Laity that much reſembles this, and has much the ſame tendency; and that is, Mens halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between two Opinions, or trimming between the Church and the Conventicle, repairing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the one, and ſometimes to the other, ſcarce ever Communicating with either, and ſo dividing from both; this is frequently ſtil'd and reputed <hi>Moderation,</hi> which is indeed no better than Lukewarmneſs, and ſuch as was rebuk'd in the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Revel.</hi> 3.15. where the Members of it being neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm and indifferent in their Duty, our Saviour threatens to <hi>Spue them out of his Mouth;</hi> ſuch Perſons as theſe ſteer their Courſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Time and Tide of worldly Intereſt or Honour lead 'em; if their Trade, or other Deſigns may be beſt promoted by the Church, they will be frequenters of that; if by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, they can as freely repair thitherto. Yea, ſome can be content to divide their Family, to carry it fair, and keep up an Intereſt in both; the Husband by conſent going to the one, and the Wife to the other. Theſe make Gain their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Godlineſs, and do not ſo much ſerve God as Mammon.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:31614:44"/>
            <p>If any of theſe moderate Men be put into an Office, of which they are obſerv'd to be not a little ambitious; they can then go to the Prayers and Sacraments of the Church to qualiſie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in it, tho' they never come more, till they are drawn by the ſame or like occaſion, which is in effect to make Sacred Things truckle to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and to take the Holy Sacrament, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Communion of the Church.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew the Falſhood of this Notion of <hi>Moderation,</hi> we muſt Note, That <hi>Moderation is a Vertue</hi> that wholly reſpects our Duty to Man, that is, to our ſelves, and one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the due regulating our Paſſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires with relation to both, but has no reſpect to our Duty unto God; for we can uſe no Mean or Moderation with relation unto him; for the ſtronger our Minds and Affections are carried out after him, the better it is; if we do any Evil, 'tis all too much, if we do any Good, 'tis all too little; there is no middle way to be obſerved here between both. Our Paſſions and Deſires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earthly Objects may be Inordinate and Extravagant, and therefore we are required to moderate them by the Rules of Prudence and Piety. But our Duty to God admits of no Exceſs, we cannot Love, deſire or ſerve him too much; and to be moderate here, is to be Lukewarm and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical. To ſhorten the appointed Prayers we are to offer to him, is to defraud our Maker of his due; yea, 'tis a ſort of Sacriledge to rob God of that portion of Devotion which the Church has ſet apart and devoted to him; and being made his, both by Divine and Human Laws, to with-hold it from him either in whole or in part, is to tranſgreſs the Rule of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by neither giving to <hi>Caeſar the things that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31614:45"/>are Caeſars, nor to God the things that are Gods,</hi> Matth. 22.21.</p>
            <p>In a word, to halt between two Opinions, is to halt between God and <hi>Baal;</hi> and he that doth his Duty by halves, and looks two different ways, does no better than falſifie and prevaricate with God and Man, for ſuch an one has no ſincerity or ſteadineſs of Mind; but like St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Man is unſtable in all his ways,</hi> James 1.8.</p>
            <p>And therefore we may not ſhelter a partial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the good Orders and Conſtitutions of the Church, under the ſacred name of <hi>Moderation,</hi> or ſeek to hide the Obliquity of it under that Vizard: But we are to call it by its right Name, <hi>viz. Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs and Hypocriſie;</hi> for if we take off the Mask from the Face of ſuch Conformity, nothing will appear under it, but Deformity and Double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing. Inſomuch as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, <hi>He that keepeth the whole Law, and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in one Point, is guilty of all,</hi> James 2.10. Becauſe he ſlights the Authority in one that Commands and Confirms all the reſt. So he that violates the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church in one thing, will eaſily do it in another, and as Intereſt and Occaſion ſerves, will be ready to do it in all. I am</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope by this time you begin to ſee the Falſhood of your Notion of Moderation, and how unjuſtly 'tis alledg'd to take off the Obligation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole or in part, to publick Orders and Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to your Plea of Toleration, to ſee what that can do towards it.</p>
            <p>And here, the great thing you inſiſt upon, is a late Act of Parliament for Exempting Proteſtant Subjects from the Penalties of ſome Laws: By which you conceive that the Conventicle ſtands upon as good, legal and firm Ground as the Church; and would have the People believe your Preaching in ſeparate Meetings, as much Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, as our publick Aſſemblies. But with what little ſhew of Reaſon this is affirm'd, I hope, the ſequel of this Letter will plainly diſcover.</p>
            <p>But firſt, I cannot but obſerve, That before the making of that Act, your Conventicles were as frequent, and with as little regret, as they have been ſince; And I find you declaring in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>June</hi> the 30th, That tho' you have a Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and allowing your Preaching, yet you ſtill counted it your Duty before, and your Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was accordingly: So that whatever claim you make to a Law, 'tis no better than a meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For 'tis plain, That you matter not the Law, but will do as you think fit, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as with it; however, ſince you have it, you will not fail to make the beſt of it. And tho' the Title of it, ſhews it only to be an Exemption
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31614:46"/>from ſome Penalties, yet you will not have it thought barely an Allowance, but an Approbation of your Aſſemblies, which ſhews how much you extend Favour further than you ſhould; and if the Government at any time give you an Inch, how apt and ready you are to take an Ell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give a check to this Vanity, I muſt tell you,</p>
            <p>2dly. That the Law you inſiſt upon, does not take off the Obligation of repairing to the Eſtabliſh'd Churches; but only ſuffers you to go unpuniſh'd, if you do otherwiſe. Now if you would rightly conſider the nature of Laws, and the true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Obedience to them, you would ſoon ſee, That the bare ſuſpending the Puniſhment, is far from annulling the Obligation of Laws: For the clearing of which, I ſhall premiſe a few things, that may help to give ſome light to it.</p>
            <p>1ſt. And Firſt, In all Laws two things are to be conſider'd, <hi>viz.</hi> a Precept, requiring ſome thing to be done, or left undone: And a Penalty to be inflicted upon the doing, or not doing of it: In the firſt of theſe conſiſts the Nature and Eſſence of a Law, which lies in commanding ſomething to be done, or not done; and this is to be a Rule to govern the Actions, and oblige the Conſciences of ſuch as are ſubjected to the higher Powers; whereas the latter is only a Circumſtance added to it to make it obſerv'd: By which it appears,</p>
            <p>2dly. That the Penalty appertains not to the Being or Eſſence of a Law, but is meerly an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Adjunct or Appendix annext to it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Obedience: Were all Men led (as they ſhould be) by Principles of Conſcience, there would be no need or uſe of Penalties; But becauſe too many thro' the pravity of their Natures, loſe the Senſe of their Duty, and are led by Humour,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31614:46"/>Intereſt and corrupt Deſigns away from it, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments become neceſſary to reduce them to it. Furthermore, you muſt note,</p>
            <p>3dly, That the main Reaſon of our Obligation to Laws, is founded on the Will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, ſufficiently made known; for he having a Commiſſion and Authority from God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in all lawful things, we are therefore bound in Duty and Conſcience to obey him therein as God's Miniſter: So that, whenſoever he duly declares and publiſhes his Mind, then does the Obligation commence; and ceaſes not, till he think fit to countermand and recall it.</p>
            <p>4thly, We muſt obſerve a double Principle or Motive of Obedience, the one for Wrath or Fear of Puniſhment, the other for Conſcience ſake; now our Obedience to Laws, is, by the Apoſtle's Direction, to be grounded on both, but chiefly on the latter; for he wills all Chriſtians to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake; ſo that if the Fear of Wrath, or the Diſpleaſure of the Magiſtrate be gone, by removing of the Penalty, there remains another and ſtronger Tye to our Duty, even the Obligation of Conſcience, which muſt hold us to it, while the preceptive part of the Law remains, tho' the coercive ceaſes.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe Propoſitions duly conſider'd, theſe two things will neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <p>1ſt. That while the Will and Pleaſure of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver is to continue a Law, which muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, till the preceptive part of it, wherein it mainly conſiſts, be repeal'd; ſo long the Law continues in force, and the Obligation of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
            <p>2dly, That the bare Suſpenſion of the Penalty, is no repealing of a Law; for while the preceptive
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31614:47"/>part, which is the Eſſence of the Law remains, it ſtill keeps its Force, and our Obedience to it is not ſuperſeded, by the ceaſing of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſhort then, ſeeing the things command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe Laws, that require Conformity to the Church, continue ſtill unrepeal'd, and nothing taken off but the Puniſhment, which belongs not to the Eſſence of them, it evidently follows, that the Obligation to them remains, and that the Subjects are ſtill bound to do what is ſtill required by them, which was the thing to be prov'd.</p>
            <p>The want of a right Underſtanding of theſe things, hath occaſioned many and great Miſtakes in this Matter: For,</p>
            <p>1ſt. It was not long, ſince you took the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the Penalty, to be the keeping of the Law; for when you were charged with Diſobedience to the lawful Injunction of Superiors, your Reply was, That tho' you did not what the Law requir'd, yet you ſuffer'd what the Law inflicted; and this you thought ſufficiently anſwer'd the end of the Law. Now the Weakneſs of this arguing will eaſily appear, by conſidering that 'tis the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Part that is the Form or Eſſence of the Law, and if you diſobey that, you cannot be ſaid to keep the Law, by undergoing the Puniſhment which is inflicted only for the Breach of it: Yea, the end of the Penalty, being only to enforce O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the thing commanded, to ſuffer the one without doing the other, is to contradict and defeat the ends of both. Indeed where the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Law is ſinful, their undergoing the Penalty is as much as a good Chriſtian may or ought to do; and in ſuch Caſes, Submiſſion is required when Obedience is not: But where the Matter of a Law neither is, nor can be proved unlawful, there 'tis not the ſuffering what is inflicted, but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31614:47"/>doing what is required that anſwers the end of the Law. For the primary Intention of all Laws, and Lawgivers, is not the Puniſhment and grieving the Subjects, but their obſerving what is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, for the good of the Common-wealth: He that thinks the Magiſtrate is well pleas'd with puniſhing the Contempt, as rewarding Obedience to his Laws, muſt think unworthily of him; and he that makes this the Rule and Meaſure of his Actions, is no better Obſerver of Laws than the Thief, or the Traytor, who are hang'd for the Breach of them. Again,</p>
            <p>2dly, As you formerly miſtook the ſuffering the Penalty for keeping of the Law; ſo now you are fallen into the quite contrary Miſtake, and take the not-ſuffering the Penalty for the keeping of it: For you imagine the late Act exempting you from the Puniſhment of ſome Laws, hath freed you from any farther Duty or Obligation to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Errors you unawares run into, merely by over looking the principal and preceptive Part of Laws, and having an Eye only or chiefly to the coercive Part; by which means, if you are not at any time ſubject, 'tis merely for Wrath, and not for Conſcience ſake. Again,</p>
            <p>3dly, This hath led you into a farther Miſtake, and made you take the ſuſpending the Penalties for the Abrogation of the Laws; for you imagine, That the Act of Uniformity, and all the Laws againſt Conventicles, to have loſt their Force from your being exempted from the Penalties of them: Which ſhews, That you place the Obligation of Laws, not in the Matter, or Things enjoined by them, but wholly and ſolely in the Penalties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to them; ſo that when theſe are taken off, the other of courſe are gone with them. Yea,</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:31614:48"/>
            <p>4thly, You have a wilder Conceit than all this; for you imagine, That the removing the Penalties, not only removes the Obligation of Laws, but eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes the things forbidden by them: For, you take Conventicles to be allow'd and eſtabliſh'd, by that Law which merely exempts you from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed for them, which ſhews your deep reach in the Knowledge of the Laws, or rather, your groſs Prevarications in the Obſervance of them.</p>
            <p>In your Letter of <hi>July</hi> 11th, you tell me, That your Places of Meeting, are as lawfully allowed as our Temples; now our Temples being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Law, yours, it ſeems, muſt have the ſame Authority: And in your Letter of <hi>June</hi> 30th, you ſay, 'tis to arraign the Government, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm otherwiſe. 'Tis to be fear'd, Sir, That your Confidence in time, will mount you ſo high, as to reckon it a Crime to go to Church, and to ſhut up all Religion and Virtue within the Walls of a Conventicle.</p>
            <p>But let us hear what you have to ſay for theſe things; and 1ſt, you tell me, That this Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to more than a Suſpenſion of the Penalty: For it allows your Congregations, guards them from Diſturbance, and exempts the Miniſters from ſerving in any ſecular Office, which is a ſort of Reward.</p>
            <p>Sir, the Allowance mentioned in that Act, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no Approbation of your Congregations, much leſs any Eſtabliſhment of them, but merely a winking at them for ſome temporal Reaſons: To keep any from diſturbing them, amounts to no more than a bare Permiſſion or Toleration: And for exempting you from ſecular Offices, 'tis a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege granted to all in holy Orders; of which you make a very bad uſe, to think it a Reward
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31614:48"/>for your making, and continuing Diviſions. But you go on to tell me, That if it were a bare Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Penalty, yet that were enough to render them void of any Obligation on your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to Obedience, becauſe they are merely Penal Laws.</p>
            <p>Sir, if you account all Laws that have a Penalty annex'd to the Breach of them, to be Penal Laws, you may then reckon the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and indeed all other Laws in that Number, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce any to be found without it: But to reckon them merely Penal upon that account, is a great Miſtake; to rectifie which you muſt know, That there are ſome Laws expreſs'd in Disjunctive Terms, requiring to do this or that, as in the Caſe of bearing ſuch an Office, or paying ſuch a Fine: Here the Law is purely Penal, and paying the Fine anſwers the end of it, being left in the Power of the Subject to chuſe either; but there are other Laws, that directly and poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſomething to be done, or not done, with a Penalty added to the Violation of it; and here 'tis not the ſuffering the Puniſhment, but obſerving the thing, that ſatisfies the Law. Of this kind are the Laws that eſtabliſh Conformity, where he that does not what is commanded, is a Tranſgreſſor of the Law, and juſtly ſuffers for the Breach of it. But you prove theſe to be merely Penal Laws, becauſe they require things that are no way apt to promote the common Good, and till we prove them otherwiſe, you will never be ſenſible of their pretended Obligation.</p>
            <p>Sir, Are Unity, Order and Decency in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, which are the ſubject of theſe Laws, things no way apt to promote the common Good? Do you not read many expreſs Precepts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to them for the Benefit and Ediſication
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31614:49"/>of the Church? Certainly, if you have any Senſe of Duty to the Laws of God, or Man, theſe things will carry more than a pretended Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>But you have one thing more to ſay in your Letter of <hi>June</hi> 28th, and that is, That the Law does not only call your Liberty an Allowance, but alſo that 'tis for the Eaſe of Conſcience. Now the Suſpenſion of the Penalty is only (ſay you) for the Eaſe of the Back and the Purſe; but 'tis the taking off the Obligation, that is for the Eaſe of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Sir, All the Eaſe granted or intended by that Act, relates only to the Perſons and Purſes of Diſſenters, which are thereby exempted from the Temporal Fines and Penalties annex'd to the Breach of ſome Laws, which is all that the Civil Magiſtrate can do; but may not be extended to the taking off the Guilt or Obligation to Eternal Puniſhments, which none but God, the ſole Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and Judge of Conſcience hath Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</p>
            <p>Now Schiſm, which is a Breach of the Peace and Unity of the Church, being forbidden by the Law of God, cannot have its Guilt or Obligation to eternal Puniſhment taken off by ſuſpending the Temporal Penalties, much leſs can it become law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or made harmleſs by humane Laws. I hope, you do not think that Impunity can void the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Divine Laws, or that a thing ceaſes to be a Sin, becauſe it ceaſeth to be puniſh'd by the Civil Magiſtrate; for then Theft, Adultery and Murder would be no Crimes, if the Puniſhment of them were at any time forborn and ſuſpended: <hi>And if Sentence againſt an evil Work be not executed preſently, the Hearts of the Children of Men might be ſafely ſet in them to do Evil,</hi> Eccleſ. viii. 11.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:31614:49"/>
            <p>But how come they to plead for Toleration now, who not long ſince, thought and ſtil'd it intolerable? Is that which was then the Mother of Confuſion, the Nurſe of Schiſm,
<note place="margin">Jus. Div. Reg. Eccl.</note> and the Step-mother of Edification, as they were wont to call it, become of a ſudden the Parent of all true Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? No certainly, the Matter is, That 'twas other Mens Caſe then, and 'tis their own now, and that makes a mighty Alteration: Are you not aſham'd of ſuch groſs Partiality, which is enough to make a Forehead of Braſs to bluſh?</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Letter with the Words of your beloved <hi>John Calvin,</hi> who tells us, That in a true Church,
<note place="margin">Inſtit. L. 4. cap. 1. Sect. 10.</note> where the Word of God is truly preach'd, and the Sacraments duly adminiſtred, none may preſume to deſpiſe the Authority, or reſiſt the Admonitions, or refuſe the Counſels, or ſlight the Corrections of it, much leſs to withdraw from it and break its Unity, and go unpuniſhed: Adding, That God ſo highly eſteems the Communion of the Church, that he accounts him a Renegade or Deſerter of Religion, who wilfully abſtains and alienates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Fellowſhip of it. By which you plainly ſee the Senſe of the Father and Founder of your Sect in this Matter. I am</p>

               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. Ult.</note> when Men began publickly to call upon the Name of the Lord. And 'tis abundantly prov'd by the Holy Scripture, and the Jewiſh Writers,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.26.</note> That Forms of Prayer and Praiſes were us'd all along in the Jewiſh Church, from whence our Bleſſed Saviour deriv'd his.</p>
            <p>Yea, many Learned Men have obſerv'd, That our Saviour was ſo far from affecting Novelties and Variations, that he took every Sentence of his Prayer out of the Jewiſh Forms then in uſe,
<note place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 158. Idem on Matth. 6.9.</note> as hath been fully prov'd by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and other Learned Men.</p>
            <p>For when Chriſt's Diſciples ask'd him, to give them a Form of Prayer, that they might be known to be his Diſciples, as the Jewiſh Doctors were wont to do to theirs: He gave them no New Prayer, but the ſame he had given them a Year and half before in his Sermon on the Mount, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as one hath well obſerv'd, becauſe there was no need of any other, and partly becauſe a better could not be given.</p>
            <p>And yet you tell me, That we build more upon this Prayer than 'twill be ever able to bear: How ſo? We build the lawfulneſs and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of uſing this and other Forms Compos'd by it; and I hope 'twill well enough bear that; and that ſo much at leaſt may be allow'd to Chriſt's Practice and Commands, as to be able to warrant theſe things. No (ſay you) 'twas deſign'd only for a Directory to frame other Prayers by, and not a Form of Prayer to be us'd in the ſame Words.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:31614:51"/>
            <p>But was it deſign'd think you, only for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory for <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer, or rather was it not a Direction to frame other publick Forms by? If you ſearch into Antiquity, you will find no mention at all of the former, whereas all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches have thro' every Age made uſe of it for the latter. Hence a very Learned Author hath told us, That all Authentick Liturgies, and ours in particular, are grounded upon, and drawn up by the Lord's Prayer. All the Collects for Grace being grounded on the three firſt Petitions; the Prayers for all Earthly Bleſſings are grounded upon the requeſt for our daily Bread; the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Litanies for Pardon and Deliverance from Sin, and all other kinds of Evils, upon the three laſt Petitions; and the Thankſgivings, Hymns and Praiſes upon the Doxology.</p>
            <p>And here, tho' in honour to our Maſter, we uſe this Prayer as a Form in the ſame Words, and likewiſe make it the Pattern and Platform of all our other Prayers and parts of Devotion; Yet you ask me as wiſe Queſtion, <hi>ſc.</hi> Whether I think my ſelf oblig'd to uſe the words of the Lord's Prayer, and no other?</p>
            <p>No, Sir, I think my ſelf oblig'd to uſe the Lord's Prayer in Obedience to the Command of my Saviour, and other Prayers Compos'd and Eſtabliſh'd according to that excellent Platform in Obedience to the Commands of my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.</p>
            <p>But how ſay you, Can we uſe the Lord's Prayer in the ſame words, and make it an invariable part of our Devotions, when the ſame words are not us'd in both the Evangeliſts that record it? For there is a variation of the Words in the 4th and 5th Petitions; in the 4th, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it, <hi>Give us this Day our daily Bread,</hi> St. <hi>Luke, Give us
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31614:51"/>Day by Day our daily Bread;</hi> in the 5th, the one hath, <hi>Forgive us our Debts as we forgive our Debtors;</hi> the other, <hi>Forgive us our Sins, for we alſo forgive them that are indebted unto us;</hi> and what is more material, ſay you, in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the Doxology is wholly left out. But, Sir, may not the difference of Copies, and the length of Time eaſily occaſion ſo ſmall an alteration? And are we not infinitly beholding to the Providence of God, in handing it down to us thro' ſo many Ages with ſo little vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? This is rather to be own'd with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, than to be made a Cavil againſt the uſe of it: May not this Day, which is ſpoken every Day, in various Copies eaſily change into Day by Day? Is there any material difference between Sins and Debts, in reſpect of God, which you grant import the ſame thing? And is this a juſt Pretence for laying aſide ſuch a Divine and Perfect Model of Devotion? And whereas the Doxology mention'd by the one, is omitted by the other; which may be aſcrib'd either to the different Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or to the difference of Tranſcribers; our Church ſeems wiſely to have comply'd with both, by uſing it ſometimes with, and ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. But,</p>
            <p>Why ſhould you be ſo unwilling to grant the Lord's Prayer to be made uſe of as a Form in the ſame Words? Sure there is ſome Myſtery in this, which is but an Objection of Yeſterday, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till very lately call'd in queſtion by any. Why,</p>
            <p>The plain deſign of it is, by endeavouring to weaken the Lord's Prayer, as a Form, to ſhake the Authority of all other Forms; and if you can find any different and varied Expreſſions there, 'twill give ſome Countenance to your other new and beloved Variations: But 'twill become you, Sir,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31614:52"/>to have better Thoughts, and likewiſe to make better uſe of this Divine Form, than to abuſe and pervert it to ſuch bad Ends; Conſidering what high Preſumption it is, to lay aſide this Prayer, as if we could Pray as well, or better without it, when it was mainly given, becauſe we cannot Pray at all.</p>
            <p>Now here you ask again, (for you ſo far ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth of what you write, that you lay it down by Queries rather than Poſitions) I ſay you ask farther, whether the Lord's Prayer as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd Form were to laſt beyond his Reſurrection, and the Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt? Why not? Is there any ſhew of Reaſon or Authority to limit it only to that time? Does not our Saviour ſay abſolutely when ye pray, ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. and when he hath not given the leaſt intimation of its being Temporary, what Preſumption is it to pretend the Precepts of Chriſt to be out of date? May not this Artifice make void all the Commandments of God by fixing them to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Period, and taking off their Obligation from all that live beyond? Take heed, Sir, of ſuch Arts.</p>
            <p>But if Chriſt had intended it for a perpetual Form, (ſay you with other of your Brethren) it cannot be imagin'd that he ſhould leave out his own Name.</p>
            <p>Sir, To ask in Chriſt's Name, is to ask through Chriſt's Merits, which did not take place till after his Death and Reſurrection; and likewiſe to ask in vertue of his Mediation, as our Interceſſor and Advocate at God's Right Hand, which was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that commenc'd not till after his Aſcenſion into Heaven; and therefore we find the Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.24.</note> who before that had asked nothing in his Name, were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31614:52"/>after injoyn'd and encouraged to ask any thing in it with an aſſurance of being heard.</p>
            <p>Beſides, tho' Chriſt's Name be not expreſly mention'd in the Lord's Prayer, yet 'tis vertually implied in almoſt every Petition of it; for we cannot call God Father, but upon the account of Chriſt; neither can we ask forgiveneſs of Sins, or deliverance from any Evils, but thro' his Mercy and Mediation; ſo that this can be no ſhadow of Reaſon, either to detract from the Honour, or to lay aſide the uſe of this Divine Form. But I muſt not wholly paſs by what you offer againſt the Teſtimonies I produc'd for the uſe of the Lord's Prayer, as a Form in the ſeveral Ages of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Age after the Apoſtles, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that is, the one Prayer or the one Supplication, muſt be underſtood of the Lord's Prayer, or of one common Prayer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by it. For if their Prayers were varied every Day, they could not properly be called one Prayer: And againſt this I do not find any Objection.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Century, when I cited the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Lucian,</hi> for the uſe of the Lord's Prayer: You except againſt him becauſe he was a Scoffing Pagan: But, Sir, may not a Scoffer be a good Witneſs for the uſe of the thing which he Scoffs at? Are not the Atheiſts and the Deiſts good Witneſſes of the general belief of a God, and the Holy Scriptures in the preſent Age, tho' them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are too apt to deny the one and deride the other?</p>
            <p>To the Teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and other Fathers in the following Ages, for the uſe of the Lord's Prayer, tho' you ſtruggle and labour hard to ſay ſomething: Yet 'tis with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31614:53"/>appearance of Reaſon or Truth, that it needs no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>And you are ſo choak'd with the Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Divines abroad, and likewiſe with the Aſſembly of Divines at home, who both us'd the Lord's Prayer themſelves, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the uſe of it as a Form to others, that you wiſely enough let it paſs without ſaying much to it: And therefore if you will take the advice of a Friend, I think you were better yield this Point, than wrangle any more about it.</p>
            <p>And thus having, I hope, pretty well clear'd the uſe of the Lord's Prayer in the ſame Words. I ſhall next conſider what you have to ſay againſt the Antiquity and uſe of Liturgies Compos'd by it. In the mean time, I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shew'd in my laſt, the Lord's Prayer to be intended as a Form, and ſo uſed by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and likewiſe vindicated it from the Diſuſe and Contempt which ſome have caſt upon it; tho' 'tis ſad that our unhappy and divided Age ſhould make ſuch a Task neceſſary. In the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31614:53"/>next place then, I am to conſider what you ſay againſt the Antiquity of Liturgies, and other Forms of Prayer compos'd by it.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice of a pretty Conceit of yours, concerning Liturgies, in your Letter of <hi>July</hi> the 6th; for finding them often mention'd in the Ancient Fathers, you think fit to put in your Claim to them, and will have them underſtood not ſo much of a Book of preſcrib'd ſtinted Forms, as of unwritten and <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers in the publick Miniſtrations.</p>
            <p>Alas! What will not ſome Men ſay or do to help out a bad Cauſe? But where, Sir, in any of the Fathers is <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, much leſs ſtil'd a Liturgy, or made any part of it? And indeed, how is it poſſible it ſhould be, when it conſiſts only of preſent and ſudden Conceptions? Were not the Ancient Liturgies the ſet and ſtanding Offices of publick and ſolemn Devotion, that were well known to the People, who bore a part in them, and had often Recourſe to them? And how can this be ſaid of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers, where neither Miniſter nor People know any thing of it before, nor ſcarce remember any thing of it after?</p>
            <p>But in this, and likewiſe in what follows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Liturgies of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> tho' you vainly think you have done great Feats, and made ſome new Diſcoveries, to the utter confounding of Liturgies; yet 'tis all taken out of a Book, Intituled, <hi>A Reaſonable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why ſome Non-conforming Miniſters refuſe to perform their Miniſterial Acts of Solemn and Publick Worſhip, by the preſcrib'd Forms of others.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe out of a Poſthumous Piece of Mr. <hi>David Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s; both which Books being ſo fully anſwered and refuted, the one by Dr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31614:54"/>of Liturgies,</hi> the other by Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> in his <hi>Original and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of them:</hi> I ſhall not need to add any thing to the Labours of thoſe learned Men, and therefore ſhall only refer you to them.</p>
            <p>But there is no valuable Antiquity, (ſay you) but the three firſt Centuries; and if the Uſe of Liturgies can't be ſound and prov'd there, you are reſolv'd to have no value for them.</p>
            <p>Sir, Though we want not Proof of the Uſe of Liturgies, in thoſe early Times of Chriſtianity: Yet learned Men have given ſuch wiſe and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſons, why we may not expect to hear ſo much of them in thoſe as in the following Ages, as may well enough ſatisfie any rational and well-meaning Man about it: If you have not conſider'd them, I will recommend ſome of them to your ſerious Conſideration: As Firſt,</p>
            <p>The Continuance of the extraordinary Gifts and Aſſiſtances of the Holy Ghoſt, for ſome Ages after the Apoſtles, may be a good Reaſon of our hearing and reading ſo little of Forms at that time; for whilſt the publick Offices of Religion were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by thoſe Gifts, there could not be ſo great need or uſe of them: And conſequently there can be no Reaſon why we ſhould expect to hear ſo much of them. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who liv'd in the Fourth Century, tells us, That the extraordinary Gift of Prayer, by which the publick Miniſtrations were perform'd, ceaſed but a little before his time: And therefore, as Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> hath well obſerv'd,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> of Liturg. p. 77.</note> this being the firſt Age of the ceaſing of theſe Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts, if Forms of Prayer then ſucceeded in the room of them, 'tis abundantly enough to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Uſe of them. Again,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſame learned Author tells us, That the Fathers of the Firſt Century, were ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31614:54"/>wholly imployed about converting the Nations to Chriſtianity, that they wrote very little; and very little of what they wrote, is, by the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Time, come down to our hands: So that, we cannot reaſonably expect much Evidence for Liturgies in this Century; wherein, yet as there is nothing againſt them, ſo we find enough from <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Joſephus, Clemens Romanus, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> to confirm us in the belief of them. Moreover,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Fathers of the Second Century likewiſe, did not write much; and in what they did, they took particular Care not to publiſh their Church-Service, leſt the Pagans, under whom they lived, ſhould deride and blaſpheme their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſteries; and therefore, we muſt not look for any clear Evidence for Liturgies as yet, when the Chriſtians conceal'd their Worſhip, for fear of expoſing it: And yet in this Age, as Churches began to be planted and ſettled, we have as much notice of Forms, as can reaſonably be look'd for, as appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Againſt which we find but two weak Objections, the one from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the other from <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Sine Monitore, quia de pectore;</hi> both which, are ſo fully anſwer'd by Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> and other learned Men, that he who ſhall urge them any further, will only ſhew himſelf endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Quality of a ſcolding Woman, to take no Anſwer, nor ſit down quietly under the cleareſt Satisfaction. Again,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We read of the Fathers of the Third Century, That tho' they wrote more, yet were ſo buſied, not only in converting of Heathens, but in confuting of Hereticks, with whom they had to do, that we can't yet expect to hear much of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31614:55"/>their way of Worſhip,
<note place="margin">Id. p. 5.</note> 
               <q>Which in thoſe Days of Perſecution, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally perform'd in private: Beſides, the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks denying the Authority of the Church, would not allow of any Arguments taken from the Rites and Offices of their Worſhip, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and appointed by it;</q> and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they made but rare and little mention of them: And yet, in this Age, we have the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Hippolytus, Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Thaumaturgus;</hi> from whom the Centuriators of <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> plainly declare, That 'tis without all Queſtion, that they had ſet Forms of Prayer in this Age.</p>
            <p>However, all theſe things well conſider'd, may abundantly ſatisfie any wiſe Man, why we cannot have ſo full and clear Evidence for theſe things, in that which you call the beſt Antiquity, the three firſt Centuries.</p>
            <p>Let us go on then to the 4th Century, which if there were no Evidence before, is time enough for our Purpoſe: This being the firſt Age (as the forecited Author obſerves) <q>When Miraculous Gifts ceaſed, and the Church was ſetled under Chriſtian Magiſtrates; for ſince, we plead for a Preſcrib'd Liturgy in an Eſtabliſh'd Church, it is as much Antiquity as our Cauſe needs, to ſhew it from this Age; which is as ſoon as the Primitive Churches Circumſtances and ours did agree.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here we are ſurrounded with Evidence for the Uſe of Liturgies, being confirmed by as many unqueſtionable Witneſſes, as any Matter of Fact can be atteſted withal, which is as much as any reaſonable Man can deſire. The ample Teſtimony of the Fathers of this, and the following Centuries, are cited in my 15th Letter, of the Antiquity of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31614:55"/>Liturgies; to which I may add, the Teſtimony of <hi>Capellus,</hi> and other Foreign Divines, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That a publick Form of Liturgy hath obtain'd, in the Univerſal Church throughout the whole World, for above Thirteen Hundred Years; and adds, That it doth now every where obtain, ſave among ſome upſtart Sects and Independents. Yea, <hi>Smectymnus,</hi> which was a Club of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Divines here at home, date the Riſe and Uſe of Liturgies from this Century, deriving it from the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which ſate about the Year 364 and likewiſe from the Councils of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> and <hi>Milevis,</hi> which ſate ſomewhat after; and being convinc'd by the Practice of this, and the following Ages, they with their Adherents, ſtill kept to the Uſe of the Publick Liturgy, till very lately, a new Race of Diſſenters are ſtarted up in theſe times of Liberty, who are Enemies to all Forms, and conſequently to all eſtabliſh'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſcipline, and ſeem inclin'd to drive the Principles of Confuſion as far as they will go.</p>
            <p>But let us hear what you have to ſay againſt theſe Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>To the Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who tells us, That <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> beſides the appointed Prayers, ordered a Form of Prayer to be compos'd for the Uſe of the Soldiers. To this you ſay, let any one judge whether this doth not prove, That there was then no publick Liturgy. What, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a new Form was drawn up for the Uſe of his Soldiers? Had not we lately, Prayers fram'd to be us'd at Sea, and will that prove that we had no Liturgy or Common-Prayer before? Are you not aſham'd of ſuch Reaſoning?</p>
            <p>To the Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Foreign Divines, you tell me, That all that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid or did, about the Uſe of Forms, was merely to comply
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31614:56"/>with the Difficulties and Darkneſs of the Time in which he lived; which you ſay, more than once, was ſo groſs that the People were perſwaded to eat Hay: And 'tis no wonder, that the Hay and Stubble of Liturgies was built upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtianity in ſuch a dark Age, or that <hi>Calvin</hi> wink'd at them in thoſe Times of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>But were all thoſe Lights that helped us out of the Darkneſs of Popery, ſo much in the dark too; and that in a Matter wherein they had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all former Ages? Certainly you think that our Reformers too, who ſhew'd greater Wiſdom than any before or ſince, were in the dark like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or at beſt, had but a weak glimmering Light, which is broke out upon you in its Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Splendor. You take the Continuance of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies to be the Continuance of Ignorance and Darkneſs, and conſequently you who lay them aſide, have a marvelous Light ſhining round about you, whereas we that continue to uſe them do but walk on ſtill in Darkneſs, and ſit in the very Regions of the Shadow of Death. One would think the bare mentioning of theſe things ſhould fill you with bluſhing, and make you aſham'd of ſuch unparallel'd Pride and Folly.</p>
            <p>But you have a worſe Charge than all this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Liturgies; and that is, That they breed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Looſneſs and Lazineſs in thoſe that uſe them, and give your Reaſons for it too, which muſt be conſider'd in my next. I am</p>

            <p>I Have been endeavouring of late to Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Matters in difference between us, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how we agree in the Main, and rectifying ſome few Miſtakes, that create and continue the difference: Hoping by this means to bring things to ſome good Iſſue. But I am ſorry to find that you are inclin'd to break off the Treaty, and whilſt we retain our Liturgy, will hear nothing of an Accommodation.

            <p>
               <q>That which I have affirm'd, and will ſtand to, is this, That the eſtabliſhing Forms for Univerſal Uſe (particularly our Liturgy) or the Impoſition of them on all Miniſters, to be uſed in publick Prayer, and none other, does open a Door for a lazy (I might venture to ſay a looſe) Miniſtry to enter in; and that in the preſent lapſed State of Diſcipline, many ſuch in the Miniſtry muſt be expected, yea, are.</q>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31614:57"/>and like an undaunted Champion that ſcorns to flinch, you will ſtand to it and prove it too: And that</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the very Nature of the thing, which will make it appear, that this Looſneſs and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are not any accidental Faults occaſioned by the Neligence of ſome Perſons, but the natural and neceſſary Effects of Liturgies; and whoſoever uſeth them, muſt unavoidably fall into theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities. Bravely charg'd! And if you purſue this well, you muſt neceſſarily rout all Liturgies out of the World. Well, but how is this made good? Why thus;</p>
            <p>The Mind of Man is naturally ſluggiſh, and will take its Eaſe, and remit the Reins if it be not urg'd by ſome Neceſſity, or attracted by Delight and Complacency; and the beſt of Men had need of all Obligations, to keep it to its Duty.</p>
            <p>Very true; but is there no way to employ the Mind, or to cure this Sluggiſhneſs, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new Prayers? Muſt the Mind neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Reins, if the Tongue be kept in with Bit and Bridle? Does the great Work and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul lie in ſtudying new Expreſſions? And muſt the Prayer be dull, and the Effect of Lazineſs, if the Phraſes are not varied? May not the Mind be well imploy'd in a hearty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout uſe of pious and well compos'd Forms? No, ſay you, a Muſician will be weary if he have conſtantly the ſame Inſtrument and Tunes: Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety pleaſes in Diet, Novelty affects in Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Commonneſs dulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Mind muſt be entertain'd as much with Varieties in Religion, as the Fancy of a Fidler with new Tunes; and we muſt have as much Change and Novelty in our Prayers, as in our Diet and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, or elſe we ſhall grow weary of them.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:31614:57"/>
            <p>And is not this an admirable way, think you, to keep Men firm and ſtable in their Religion, to be daily ringing Changes, and putting the Matter of their Prayers every Day into new Phraſes? Hath not this Variety of Prayers already, begot a Variety of Opinions? Does not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tell you, that this is apt to breed Giddineſs and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy? And have we not found Confuſion enough already from this Principle, but you muſt needs cheriſh it to breed more?</p>
            <p>But muſt all Men neceſſarily be lazy, that uſe a Liturgy? Then what a parcel of idle, lazy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have all former Chriſtians been through every Age, that have ſpent their time only in the old <hi>Mumpſimus</hi> of Forms, without taking any Pains to invent, or make any new Prayers of their own? This, Sir, is a Calumny ſharper than a two-edged Sword, that wounds the whole Catholick Church, and cuts through all Generations. But is there no taking Pains in Prayer, without the Invention and ſtudy of new Words? Does not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Work of it lie in taking Pains with the Heart, to keep that cloſe and intent upon the Duty, which is much better pains-taking than pumping for new Phraſes, this being for the moſt part but Labour in vain, and ſuch as may very well be let alone? For ſince, the whole Matter of publick Prayers may be, and is compriz'd in well-digeſted Forms, what need can there be to cloath it in a daily Change and Diverſity of Expreſſions? Yea, this is not only needleſs, but hurtful Labour; for it takes of the Heart from the main Work, and hinders it from minding the great Buſineſs of Prayer. And will you charge them with Lazineſs, who only decline ſuch loſt Labour, and in the mean time employ themſelves to much better purpoſe?</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:31614:58"/>
            <p>Beſides, Sir, There is no ſuch great Labour in this <hi>Extempore</hi> way of Praying, as you would have the World believe: 'Tis a Knack that is eaſily learn'd and eaſily perform'd; a Teeming Imagination, and a ready Tongue will pour out Words enough without any great pains or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and he that hath gotten any dexterity this way, may as eaſily impoſe upon the People with this ſlight of the Tongue, as Juglers do with the ſlight of Hand: And I think, if all things were well known, this will be found a more looſe and lazy way of Praying, than that which you charge with it. But you have</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another way of proving this Charge, and that is, by appealing to the Experience of Mankind, whether ſuch an Impoſition does not tend to let in a lazy Miniſtry? And here I think the Experience of the beſt and wiſeſt part of Mankind will be clearly againſt you; for they ſee and know, that keeping to a Form of ſound Words in Prayer, will help to keep Men more ſteady and ſound in their Religion, more ſerious and diligent in the ſober Exerciſe and Practice of true Devotion, than your changeable Method and Study of Variations. But</p>
            <p>May not a Child of Ten Years Old, (ſay you) read the Prayers and Homilies as diſtinctly and laudably as a learned Divine? I think very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And he muſt be a very forward Child that can arrive to that at thoſe Years. But if this may be done, 'tis rather a Commendation than Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of our Liturgy and Homilies, that all things in them are brought down to the meaneſt Capacities, ſo that the youngeſt Perſons can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly read them; and he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, may ſay, <hi>Amen</hi> to them; and if this may be done by young Children in our
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31614:58"/>Prayers, 'tis more than can be done by Older and Wiſer Men in yours. But if ſo conſiderable a part of a Miniſters Work, ſay you, be only to read a Liturgy, that may be done as laudably <hi>Extempore,</hi> as upon the longeſt Premeditation. And why ſhould you not like that which helps you to Read as well as to Pray <hi>Extempore?</hi> The pains after a little uſe is much the ſame; and the only difference is, that the Mind is better edified by the one, and the Fancy more gratified by the other.</p>
            <p>But 'twill be hard, ſay you, to convince Men, that the Gift of Reading is more admirable in the Miniſter at Church, than in their Children at Home: This is the ſame with that profane Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome looſe Perſons, who ask, what need they go to Church, when they can read the ſame, or as good things at home? But, Sir, are not the publick Offices of Religion to be prefer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the private? Hath not our Saviour promis'd a greater Bleſſing to them that aſſemble and meet together in his Houſe, than thoſe that abide at home in their own?
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.25.</note> And does not the Apoſtle give a ſtriſt Charge to Chriſtians, not to forſake the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelves together, as the manner of ſome is?</p>
            <p>Beſides, does not the Order, Office, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity deriv'd by Chriſt upon his Miniſters, give a greater Efficacy and Solemnity to the Prayers, when delivered by them, than when they are read by private Perſons without ſuch Authority?</p>
            <p>Does it become you, Sir, to ſtrike in with ſuch Careleſs, Looſe and negligent Wretches, and to urge the ſame Objections in defence of your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, as they are wont to do to Countenance their Profaneneſs?</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:31614:59"/>
            <p>Nothing, I ſee, comes amiſs to you, that may any way ſerve your Turn, and you ſtick not to make uſe of any Enormity that will help to keep up the Diſſenting Cauſe. Of this kind, is that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the People, Ask, ſay you, many Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> whether a moſt pious Liturgy is a competent ſupply for the want of an able, pious Miniſter? As if a pious Liturgy, and a Pious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter were things inconſiſtent. And elſewhere you ſooth the People, by putting into their Mouths that Canting Language, Oh! Don't think that to read to us thoſe Words, that our Children can read every Day at home, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is enough to cure ſuch dark, dead, diſaffected Souls as ours, which are Words meerly contriv'd, <hi>ad Captandum vulgum,</hi> and plainly ſhew, what Game you are playing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>But to make good this Charge of Lazineſs againſt the Conforming Clergy, you urge two or three things more, which muſt be conſider'd. As firſt,</p>
            <p>That the Gift of praying <hi>Extempore,</hi> is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qualification for the Miniſterial Function, and ſhould be the Teſt of Ordination. Next, that they who have this Gift are bound to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it in their publick Miniſtrations, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Command to the contrary. Laſtly,</p>
            <p>The neglect of this Gift hath been the occaſion of Looſneſs, Lazineſs, and other Immoralities. With what little appearance of Reaſon or Truth theſe things are affirm'd, muſt be ſhew'd in my next. I am</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been conſidering the heavy Charge of Looſneſs and Lazineſs which you put upon the uſe of Liturgies; and have in ſome meaſure ſhewed the Falſhood and Injuſtice of it.</p>
            <p>However, to make it good, and to keep the Mind conſtantly employed, you make the Gift of Praying <hi>Extempore,</hi> a neceſſary Qualification of the Miniſterial Function; and will ſcarce allow any to be fit or capable of Holy Orders, that want this Faculty, or forbear the uſe of it. For</p>
            <p>You tell me in your firſt Letter, that you are perſwaded, That the Almighty hath in this Age a great multitude of Suppliants, that can, and do expreſs Holy Deſires underſtandingly, orderly and aptly, without any penn'd or preſcribed Forms, and that Miniſters ſhould be ordinarily able to do ſo. And a Brother of yours lays it down, That the Church ſhould judge of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Gift of Prayer, before ſhe truſt him with the publick Miniſtry.
<note place="margin">Reaſon. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, p. 13.</note> So that all that have not this Talent of Variations, or forbear to uſe it in publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are but Uſurpers of Holy Orders, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders into the Miniſters Office. Now had not this need to be well prov'd, that reflects ſo groſly upon all ſetled Churches, where never any ſuch thing was ever made a Queſtion or Qualification for Holy Orders? And yet that ſame Author tells us,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31614:60"/>That if all Miniſters in the conſtant uſe of their daily Prayers, cannot out-do the perfection and exactneſs of the beſt Compos'd Forms,
<note place="margin">Idem, p. 157.</note> it is to the ſhame of the Church of God in <hi>England.</hi> Now is it not a ſhame think you, for Men to own or utter ſuch wild and extravagant Speeches?</p>
            <p>But what is the Proof, that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for this bold Aſſertion?
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.14.</note> Why, nothing but that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</hi> Neglect not the Gift of God that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the Hands of the Presbytery. In which yet there is not any of the leaſt mention made of Prayer, and much leſs of performing it by any ſuch Gift.
<note place="margin">Ver. 13, and 15.</note> In the Verſe before, the Apoſtle wills him to give attendance to Reading, Exhortation and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; and in the Verſe after, to mediate on theſe things: So that if you will needs have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there ſpeak of Prayer, it muſt be rather of reading Compos'd Premeditated Forms, than pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out New and <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Gift there intended by the Apoſtle, was the Miniſterial Office or Function which was given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> by the laying on of Hands; and his willing him not to neglect it, was an Exhortation to a faithful and diligent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Duty of his Place. But the Miſchief is, ſome Men are ſo vainly conceited of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that where ever they find the word Gift mention'd in the Scripture, they will needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of this Gift of Prayer. Hence ſome think they have found it in that Advice of St. <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6, 7.</note> Having Gifts differing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Grace of God given to us, whether Prophecy, let us Propheſy according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31614:60"/>of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. In which the Apoſtle hath no Reference at all to it, for the Gifts he refers to, are particularly reckon'd up in the following Verſes, where no ſuch Gift of Prayer is either nam'd or implied; or if it were, could be meant only of that Supernatural Gift of Prayer, by which the publick Offices were at that time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
            <p>Others imagine they have found it in thoſe words of St. <hi>Peter,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.10.</note> As every one hath receiv'd the Gift, even ſo Miniſter the ſame one to another;</hi> which Words are commonly interpreted of Alms, which the Apoſtle would have imparted as occaſion ſhould require: But cannot with any congruity of Senſe have any Reference to Prayer, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of Miniſtring one to another, whereas in Prayer, <hi>He that Miniſtreth, Miniſtreth to God only, to whom alone our Prayers are directed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this Gift be not to be ſound in either of theſe places,
<note place="margin">James 1.17.</note> they think they cannot fail of it in that of St. <hi>James, Every good Gift, and every perfect Gift is from above,</hi> and which Words being ſo general, they think muſt neceſſarily comprechend it. But if there were no appearance of any ſuch Gift at that time, or ſince, why ſhould we think that this muſt needs comprehend it? Beſides, the Gifts mentiou'd by St. <hi>James,</hi> are good and perfect Gifts, and ſuch as came down from above; whereas the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that attend your pretended Gift, and the many Evils that have proceeded from, and are ſtill continued by it, ſhew it to have no Title to either. Yea, the Miſchief done by this black Art of Variations, ſhews it came rather from the Fiends of Darkneſs than Father of Lights, with whom is no Variableneſs, neither ſhadow of Change.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:31614:61"/>
            <p>However, theſe Men having ſtrongly poſſeſs'd themſelves with vain Imaginations of this Gift, think themſelves bound to uſe it, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but againſt the Authority of their Superiors; for one of them tells us, That this Gift is a Mean given by God for the performance of the Duty of Prayer, and therefore may not be omitted at the Command of Man; for they are required not to neglect, but to ſtir up the Gift of God that is in them, and are called upon daily to imploy and improve the Talent that is committed to them.</p>
            <p>But is it a ſinful neglect think you, of your own Gifts, at any time to make uſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures of others in Divine Worſhip? And muſt all the Gifts we have, or imagine our ſelves to have, be conſtantly Exercis'd upon pain of being thought Idle and Lazy Perſons?</p>
            <p>Why then, as a Reverend Divine hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, He that hath any Talent in Greek and Hebrew, may not uſe the Tranſlation of the Bible drawn up by others, but muſt for the Exerciſe of his Gifts make a new Tranſlation of his own, and vary it too, if he can, as oft as he hath occaſion to quote it. Again, he that is able to gather the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith into a brief Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, may not make uſe of the Creed drawn up by others for that purpoſe, but muſt for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his own Gifts be daily making of new Creeds.</p>
            <p>Once more, he that hath any Talent in Poetry or Muſick, muſt not make uſe of Pſalms ſet to Muſick or Meeter by others, but for the Exerciſe of his own Gifts, muſt be ſtill making new Hymns of his own, and if he can, daily ſet them too to new Tunes. Theſe things are every jot as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, upon the account of exerciſing Mens Gifts, as it is to lay aſide the pious and well compos'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31614:61"/>Forms of others, and think themſelves oblig'd to be daily making new Prayers of their own.</p>
            <p>But the Preſervation of any Gift or Faculty, ſay you, depends on the Exerciſe of it, and it muſt be extreamly prejudic'd and impair'd by Diſuſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, There are Times and Occaſions enough for the Exerciſe, and improving your Gifts, without affecting or making new Prayers, which are more hurtful than helpful to true Devotion: As for the Gift of Speech, which you ſtill Miſtake for the Gift of Prayer, that may well enough be preſerv'd by daily Diſcourſe and Converſation, eſpecially if they are applyed to wiſe and uſeful Subjects; whereas the true and proper Gift of Prayer, is better preſerv'd and improv'd too, by a devout and diligent Application of the Heart and Soul, to the known Words of a well-digeſted Form, than by the Study of new and varied Words in an <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer.</p>
            <p>But does not this ſet aſide the Gifts of good Men in Prayer, to be thus confin'd to Forms? No, it only ſets aſide ſuch Gifts as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-ſmith boaſted of in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, and Weavers and Coblers have pretended to in ours: But it ſets aſide none of the Gifts of wiſe, godly, and authorized Perſons, who find Work enough to employ their greateſt Abilities to the Glory of God, and the good of the Church, in the Uſe of theſe Forms, which are enjoin'd for the Unity and Decency of publick Worſhip: And to tell you the Truth, the not ſetting aſide the pretended Gifts of theſe gifted Brethren, by publick Authority, hath employed the Gifts of the beſt and ableſt Perſons, to lay them aſide by Argument and Perſwaſion; to keep ignorant, bold, and unauthorized Perſons, from foaming out their own Shame, to the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Religion, Increaſe of Athciſm, and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31614:62"/>of the whole Church of Chriſt. And if theſe do not prevail, 'tis time for Authority to work, leſt they who would now be indulg'd as weak Brethren, do by that means, in a little time, grow too ſtrong for their Maſters.</p>
            <p>But to carry on the Charge of Looſneſs and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, you farther add, That the Neglect of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mens Gifts in <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer, hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them from ſtudying the Scriptures and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Books; that reading the Liturgy tempts them to lay the Reins upon the Neck of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Inclinations, makes them waſte their Time in Drinking, Sports and Recreations, and gives them Leiſure to frequent Fairs, Markets, and Coffee-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here are a great many Bolts ſhot at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſerve only to ſhew the Badneſs of a Cauſe, that muſt be ſupported by ſuch Calumnies.</p>
            <p>As for what you ſay of the Liturgies hindring Men from the Study of the Scriptures, what a wild Accuſation is this, when the Uſe of the Liturgy conſiſts altogether in the reading of the Scriptures, and of devout Prayers compos'd by them, where all the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> are appointed to be read over every Month, the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament once, and of the New thrice a Year, beſide what they may do in private at other times: And is this the way to hinder Men from ſtudying and underſtanding the Scripture?</p>
            <p>Sir, If you had ſtudied and underſtood the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as you ought, you might ſoon ſee the Baſeneſs and Wickedneſs of ſuch falſe Accuſations.</p>
            <p>As for what you ſay of Leiſure for Fairs, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and Coffee houſes, there may be many juſt and neceſſary Occaſions, that may call Men of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions to thoſe Places; and this can be no fault in any, if they are not unneceſſarily or unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31614:62"/>frequented, much leſs, is this to be charg'd upon the Liturgy: For if you look abroad, you will find the Frequenters of Conventicles, as great Frequenters of thoſe Places as any others.</p>
            <p>As for what you ſay of a Liturgy's making Men lay the Reins upon the Neck of their voluptuous Inclinations, this is either a foul Calumny, or a Fallacy of <hi>non Cauſa pro Cauſa;</hi> for what is there in godly Forms that ſhould lead Men to ſuch Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? Or, what Evil can there be in that way in which all before you worſhipped the God of our Fathers? No, Sir, thoſe Vices proceed not from the publick Prayers, but from Mens private Deſigns and corrupt Appetites, which are but too viſible and predominant in thoſe you ſtile the Godly Party, who decry Forms of Prayer, and at the ſame time, place all their Religion in a Form of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>So that your Bolts, you ſee, are ſhot at Rovers, for they glance back and wound your ſelves as deeply as any others; and your heavy Charge of Looſneſs and Lazineſs on the uſe of the Liturgy, ſerves only to ſhew your Ignorance or Deſign, not the leaſt Reaſon or Truth in the Accuſation. But here you have ſomething to ſay concerning the ſilencing of your painful Miniſters, which ſhall be conſider'd in my next. I am</p>

            <p>HAving vindicated the Liturgy from your foul and unjuſt Aſperſions, and wiped off the Dirt you ſo liberally caſt upon them that uſe it, 'twill be requiſite to obſerve your high Encomiums of <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer, and the mighty Character you give of thoſe that exerciſe their Talent this Way: For, how freely ſoever you calumniate the former as Idle Lazy Drones; the latter never fail of the glorious Titles of Able, Godly, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters: And that becauſe they will not dull their Parts with the ſame old Words of a Form, but daily labour for new Expreſſions, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Hearers with grateful Varieties.</p>
            <p>And is it fit, ſay you, that the Mouths of ſuch painful Men ſhould be ſtopp'd? Yes, when they take pains to ſo bad purpoſe, and their grateful Varieties of Prayers, lead only to an ungrateful Variety of Sects and Opinions. When they open their Mouths, to the reviling and rending the Church, and undermining the Government under which they live, 'tis but fit and neceſſary they ſhould be ſtopp'd.</p>
            <p>We undermine the Government! I would have you to know, ſay you, That we adhere to King <hi>William,</hi> and highly value his Government, and take our ſelves to be a true valuable part of it: [But mark what follows;] tho' there be ſome Orders of it that we cannot think good, nor conform to.</p>

Why thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers of the Church that were compil'd by our firſt Reformers, and enjoin'd by all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes and Parliaments ever ſince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd likewiſe by the Authority and Practice of the preſent King; and yet you cannot think them good, and will not conform to them. So that you like King <hi>William</hi>'s Government, juſt as you did theirs who went before him; that is, you will obey what you pleaſe, and conform only to what you have a mind to: Which is juſt as when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael, to do only what is right in your own eyes.</hi> And are they not excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Subjects think you, and great Lovers of the Government, that ſet up their own weak, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilful Judgments above all the Wiſdom and Authority of their Superiors, and ſeek by a few fulſom, flattering Commendations, to atone for the Contempt and Diſobedience of the Laws? 'Tis not forgotten, Sir, how you applauded King <hi>James</hi>'s Government, and concurr'd with him in taking away the Penal Laws and Teſt, which would have undermin'd the Reformation, and brought in all thoſe Evils which wiſe and good Men ſaw juſt Reaſon to fear: And if you had any Modeſty left, this might ſtop your Mouths from calling thoſe Jacobites and Popiſhly affected, who wiſely foreſaw and prevented thoſe Miſeries, which your corrupt Deſigns and intemperate Zeal would have brought upon us.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, you can like any King or no King, as it beſt ſerves your Purpoſes; and are ſo vainly conceited of your own Worth and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that none is fit to govern or preſcribe to you but your ſelves. If Governors ſay and do as you would have them, that is, if they give any Countenance to your Diviſions, you can then
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31614:64"/>ſpeak up for them, they ſhall be be no leſs than the Glory of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Healers of all our Breaches: But if they ſhew their Diſlike to your Schiſms and Conventicles, which have been cenſur'd by all Governments, and condemned by all your own Brethren that have gone before you, then your Tongues are turn'd, and we hear of nothing but Impoſitions and Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Indeed, your Praiſes and Diſpraiſes are deſign'd for tacit Directions, what you would have done, and both are founded on ſo ill a Bottom, that it deſerves little regard on whom you beſtow either the one or the other.</p>
            <p>But we were ſilenc'd, ſay you, not for refuſing a Liturgy, for the Commiſſioners at the <hi>Savoy</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpake a Word againſt a Liturgy or ſet Forms of Prayer, but only of Emendations and Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſeveral Forms, with a Liberty of uſing one or the other.</p>
            <p>Is not this a plain Proof of what was juſt before affirm'd? You are not againſt a Liturgy, but you muſt have ſuch a one as you pleaſe; it muſt be altered and amended as you will have it, and when that is done, you muſt have one of your own making to be ſet up by its ſide, with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of uſing one or the other. Who now, muſt be the Judge or Governor in this Caſe? Or whoſe Will muſt carry it, either they to whom the Care of the Church is committed, or they who are ſubjected to their Rule and Governance? The former thinks fit to continue and eſtabliſh the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgy, which is conſonant to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Ancient Models of the Chriſtian Church: Whereas you will needs have this laid aſide, or one of a new or different Make ſet up in Oppoſition to it: Now which, think you, ought in Reaſon to take place? If you knew but your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31614:64"/>own Place, and obeyed them that have the Rule over you in the Lord, it would be no Queſtion, but inſtead of that, you muſt have your own New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangl'd Liturgy; or elſe you are reſolved to be as factious and troubleſome as you can: And if the Government will not ſubmit to you, and give you your own way, you care not what Evils or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion come of it. Will you never mortifie this notorious and intolerable Pride?</p>
            <p>But you ask, What will Poſterity ſay or think, when they hear or read of the ſilencing of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly and painful Miniſters? Why, the ſame that our Predeceſſors always did; who thought it fit and neceſſary, to ſilence all ſuch as would not ſubmit to the Conſtitution and good Orders of the Church: Your Friend Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> who was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conſulted in his Time, about theſe Matters, was clearly for ſilencing Miniſters in ſuch Caſes; as you may find him cited at large,
<note place="margin">Unreaſ. of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat. p. 21, 22.</note> by the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And all Chriſtian Churches have ever done the ſame to this Day; and 'tis no more than what our Saviour would have done to thoſe that will not hearken to the Church: Yea, Poſterity would have reckon'd it a great Blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent Age, if it had continued thoſe in publick Miniſtrations of the Church, who refuſe to conform to the Offices and good Orders of it.</p>
            <p>But theſe Men, ſay you, were not ſilenc'd for any Irregularities, Inſufficiency, or Immoralities, as ſome have formerly been.</p>
            <p>Sir, They were ſilenc'd for as great, if not greater Enormities than theſe; 'twas for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractorineſs to Government, and Diſobedience to Laws made for Order and Unity, which are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Evils, and have a more pernicious Influence upon the publick than particular Mens private
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31614:65"/>Immoralities. Yea, to tell you the Truth, things were then at that paſs, that they were telling of Noſes, and counting their Numbers, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Party could not over-balance the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and force it to a Complyance with them: And their frequent Boaſtings of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ever ſince, and their daily Endeavours to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the People to increaſe their Party, plainly ſhew what they are ſtill driving at, and may be a warning to Authority, to have a watchful Eye over them, to prevent their Deſigns: Their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government are looſe, and their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it is much looſer; and tho' the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evils of Atheiſm and Deiſm call for our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prayers and Endeavours to withſtand them, yet theſe Men can eaſily over-look theſe things, to ſerve their other Purpoſes. But,</p>
            <p>To ſhew the Hardſhip of their ſilencing, you rub up ſome of the old threadbare Objections of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, againſt the Liturgy, which have been ſo often and ſo throughly anſwered, that 'tis a Wonder how you can have the Face to mention them any more, as againſt the Calendar, which contains wholſom Directions for Reading the Holy Scriptures, through the whole Courſe of the Year: Againſt the Rule for finding out <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which depending upon the various Courſe of the Moon, can ſcarce be reduc'd to greater Certainty; and one would think, you ſhould like this well enough, if it were but for the ſake of its Variation; againſt the Rubrick, the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pſalms, ſome Expreſſions in <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>'s Creed, and other Offices of the Church; all which, are ſo agreeable to the Senſe and Doctrin of Antiquity, that no wiſe and well-meaning Perſon need entertain any Scruples about them.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:31614:65"/>
            <p>Indeed, there never was, or can be, any thing ſo well-deviſed by the Wit of Man, but what in time, ſome evil Spirits will find ſomething to carp and cavil at; we find the Holy Scriptures themſelves, can ſcarce eſcape the Laſh and Cenſure of ſome Men: And if the Enemies of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, ever ſince the firſt hatching of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could find no greater Flaws in it than thoſe you mention, there is greater Cauſe to admire its Excellency, than to cavil at its Imperfection. So that upon the whole, nothing you alledge can juſtifie your Separation, or give any juſt Cauſe to complain of your ſilencing. But when I ask'd, if theſe Men were ſo juſtly ſilenc'd, how came they to ſpeak again, and in Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles too, which they themſelves had ſpoken ſo much againſt? You have ſomething to ſay in Anſwer to it, which ſhall be conſider'd in my next. I am</p>

            <head>LETTER XVI.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shew'd you in my laſt, what juſt Reaſon there was for Silencing your able and painful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that refus'd to conform to the Laws both of Church and State. I come now to conſider, whether the Perſons thus Silenced, may and ought to open their Mouths again in the Publick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Miniſtry, without, and againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Authority of your Lawful Superiors?</p>
            <p>The Negative whereof being aſſerted in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letter, I ſhall in this ſhew the weakneſs of what you urge in Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Laying down this for the Ground-work, That to Preach in any ſetled Church, without, or againſt the Authority of Superiors, is repugnant, not only to the Subjection we owe to them, but likewiſe to all thoſe Laws of God, that require Peace, Order, Unity and Diſcipline in his Church; for 'tis utterly impoſſible, That all, or any of theſe things ſhould be kept up, if every one may gather a Congregation, and Officiate where he pleaſes, againſt the known Eſtabliſh'd Laws both of Church and State. God is not the Author of Confuſion, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 32, 33. And therefore wills, That the Spirits of the Prophets ſhould be ſubject to the Prophets, implying, That Inferior Miniſters ſhould be ſubject to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, that ſo, Order, Peace and Diſcipline may be preſerv'd.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:31614:66"/>
            <p>Indeed, where there is no true Church, nor any legal Miniſters duly ſetled, there Neceſſity and Charity will give great Allowances; But for any to thruſt himſelf into anothers Charge, and Officiate there againſt the Conſent of the Lawful Paſtor, is not only to be a Buſy-body in other Men's Matters, but to be a Troubler of the Church, and a Sower of Sedition: For this muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably breed Jealouſies, Sideings and Diviſions; the People in ſuch Caſes naturally falling into Compariſons between Teachers; and as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> one was for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and a third for <hi>Cephas,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. So one will be for this Teacher, another for that, and a third for neither, and ſo will be for heaping to themſelves Teachers, having itching Ears, by which means they will come not to endure ſound Doctrin, but will turn away their Ears from the Truth, and be turned unto Fables, 1 <hi>Tam</hi> 4 3, 4. The truth of this our own woful Experience may too ſadly verifie. And therefore,</p>
            <p>We find the Old Non-conformiſts were utterly againſt the Preaching of ſuch Miniſters as were Silenced by the Eſtabliſhed Laws; For when the Browniſts, who were legally Silenced, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Separation by drawing the People into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings, they were highly blamed, and written againſt, by the Old Non conformiſts, as you may ſee at large in the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Unreaſonableneſs of Separation, <hi>pag.</hi> 82, 83.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Beza</hi> was conſulted in this Point, he plainly declar'd the utter unlawfulneſs of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparate Meetings, and Preaching without, or againſt the Eſtabliſh'd Laws, dreading and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he tells us, the many ſad and doleful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch Practices. As you may find him quoted by the ſame Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 21.22. So that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31614:67"/>the Diſſenters of our Days are clearly gone off from the peaceable Principles of the Old Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, and are fallen into that rigid and wilful Separation which they ſo ſeverely condemned.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> the great Ring-leader of this high flown Separation, hath ſomething to ſay, for Silenc'd Miniſters keeping Separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Preaching without, and againſt the Laws, which you have tranſcrib'd from him; 'twill be requiſite to take ſome Notice of it, and what I ſhall Animadvert upon it, will ſerve for an Anſwer to both. And here, you</p>
            <p>Firſt, Urge ſome places of Scripture, as our Saviour's Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, to <hi>Go, and teach all Nations,</hi> promiſing to be with them to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Wo be to me,</hi> if <hi>I preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. But to how bad Purpoſes theſe are applied to your Caſe, will be obvious to any that will conſider the different State of things in the Apoſtles, and our Days. For the Apoſtles lived under Heathen Governors, who for bad them to ſpeak in the Name of Chriſt, and required them to ſtifle that Meſſage which they had in Charge to deliver, and therefore might well ask the Queſtion, whether it were not more fit to <hi>Obey God rather than Man?</hi> Whereas, Thanks be to God we live under Chriſtian Princes, who not only embrace the Chriſtian Religion themſelves, but guard it with good Laws, to propagate its Doctrin, and preſerve its Peace and Unity.</p>
            <p>Again, the Apoſtles received not their Calling and Authority from Men, or by the Hands of Men, but immediately from Chriſt himſelf, and therefore might not be reſtrained, or be depoſed by Men.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:31614:67"/>
            <p>Whereas, we (tho' we Execute a Function whereof God is the Author, and are alſo called of God to it, yet we) are called and ordain'd by the Hands and Miniſtry of Men, and may therefore by the Miniſtry of Men be depoſed and reſtrain'd from the Exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>Hence we find the Old Non-conformiſts declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That whilſt the Biſhops ſuſpend and deprive according to the Laws of the Land, ſo long we account their Action therein as an Act of the Church, which we muſt and ought to Reverence and yield Obedience to; and if it be ſaid, The Church is not to be obey'd, when it Deprives or Suſpends for ſuch Cauſes, as we in our Conſciences know to be inſufficient: They anſwer, That it lieth in them to Depoſe, who may Ordain, and they may Shut, that may Open, or elſe there could be no Proceedings againſt any Guilty Perſon that depraves the Doctrin, or diſturbs the Peace of the Church, who will always think or pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Apoſtles had ſuch an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Guidance and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, as led them into all Truth, ſo that they could not err in the delivery of their Meſſage, whereas we cannot now without Vanity pretend to any ſuch immediate Aſſiſtances; or if we ſhould, daily Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience would apparently confute it; Men frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falling into thoſe Errors, both in Opinion and Practice, that make it neceſſary to reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things well conſider'd, plainly ſhew the Difference between the Apoſtles Caſe and ours, in reſpect of the publick Exerciſe of the Miniſtry; which is ſo manifeſt, That St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Wo be to me, if I Preach not the Goſpel,</hi> might be ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into, <hi>Wo be to the Goſpel,</hi> if Preached by ſuch Men.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:31614:68"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But 'tis Sacrilege,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to alienate Conſecrated Perſons from the Work to which they are ordain'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, If any Conſecrated Perſons will alienate themſelves from their proper Work, through their own Default, at whoſe Door muſt the Sacriledge lie? Do they not rob God and the Church too, of the Service they owe to both, by rendring themſelves unfit or uncapable of performing it? And may not Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and other notorious Offenders be depriv'd or reſtrain'd from the Exerciſe of the Miniſtry, for fear of Deſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Holy Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Notorious Neceſſities of the People,</hi> ſay you, <hi>many of which are in darger of periſhing through Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Senſuality and Debauchery, call for our Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, There are Regular and Well qualified Men enough in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the People in all things neceſſary to their Salvation; and Thanks be to God, there is no want of ſuch as are both able and willing to do ſo; our Churches are all open, where the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion are plainly unfolded, the Rules of a good Life earneſtly preſs'd, and the Danger of Debauchery, and all vicious Courſes fully repreſented. And 'tis not leſs than a Calumny, and manifeſt Untruth to inſinunte, That any are in danger of Periſhing for lack of Knowledge. The greateſt Miſchief is, from your Evil Arts of ſeducing and drawing the People from thoſe places where theſe things are clearly ſet before them. And the Atheiſm, Debauchery, and other Evils you complai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of, are evidently occaſion'd by your Separation; for when Men diſcover the Fraud and Falſhood of your vain Pretences, they begin to ſuſpect the Truth of Religion it ſelf, and are thence led to throw off all.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:31614:68"/>
            <p>Beſides, if you would Preach where there is moſt need, you ſhould repair to thoſe Places, where the Goſpel is not yet planted, and ſcatter your Light in ſome of the dark Corners of the Earth: But inſtead of that, you are for Exerciſing your Talent, not where is the greateſt need of Inſtruction, but where you may reap the greateſt benefit by Diviſion.</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>That the People have as true a Right to their Souls, as we have to our Tithes; and an Atheiſtical Popiſh Prince or Patron, can no more impoſe a Miniſter upon them, than he can chuſe Wives, Diet, Phyſick, and force them to take them.</hi> And</p>
            <p>In another Letter, you ſay, That <hi>for above a Thouſand Years after Chriſt, he was to be taken for no Biſhop that was choſen by the Magiſtrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Clergy's Election, and the Peoples choice and conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to ſet you right in this Matter: 'Tis granted, That Biſhops formerly were, and ſtill are Elected by the Clergy, at which, in ancient Times, ſome of the People were preſent to give their Teſtimony concerning their Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: Which Practice was grounded on that of the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 7. <hi>A Biſhop muſt be Blameleſs, and of good Report:</hi> But in proceſs of Time, the People from the bare giving teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, put in their Claim to their Conſent in the Election. And this begat thoſe Diſturbances, Factions and Troubles in the Church, that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd the ſetling this Matter by Laws and Canons. The Nomination of Biſhops being ſetled in the Emperors, and the Donation of Churches, in ſuch as erected or endow'd them; by which means, Peace was reſtor'd to the Church, and that liberal
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31614:69"/>Proviſion made for it, which to this Day, it in ſome meaſure Enjoys.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and his Followers, to gratifie the People, and diſturb the Church, would fain renew this Quarrel, and revive thoſe popular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to chooſing their Miniſters, which occaſion'd ſo many and great Diſturbances.</p>
            <p>Of this kind is your arguing from Men's chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Wives, Diet, <hi>&amp;</hi>c. in which they have a natural Right for their own private Peace and Comfort, to their chooſing of Biſhops and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, in which the publick Peace and Welfare of the Church are ſo much concern'd: Between which, as there is a great Difference, ſo to argue from one to the other, is a manifeſt Inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget a famous Argument of yours, for Preaching without, or againſt Laws, and that is taken from a certain Church-relation, which you ſay, there was between Paſtor and People, which the <hi>Barthelomew</hi> Act was not able to diſſolve.</p>
            <p>Where, Sir, do you read of any ſuch indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relation? Who hath ty'd this <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot between Paſtor and People ſo faſt, that no Power upon Earth is able to unty it? Or where has God ſo firmly join'd them together, that no Man may put them aſunder?</p>
            <p>The neareſt, and cloſeſt Relation that we know of, is that between Husband and Wife; and yet, that admits of a Divorce, and may be diſſolved in caſe of Adultery; and is this Covenant and Relation between Miniſter and People, the only ſacred and inviolable Bond that cannot be broken? Are they ſo inſeparably link'd together, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can part them? May a Miniſter Preach Hereſie,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31614:69"/>Schiſm, Blaſphemy, or Sedition, and yet muſt not be Silenc'd or remov'd from his Beloved, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seduc'd People?</p>
            <p>Certainly this is a new Covenant of a very late invention, and like the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Covenant, ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Lawful Authority, which it manifeſtly tends to ſubvert and deſtroy.</p>

<note place="margin">Lightfoot, Vol. 2. p. 122. &amp;c.</note> but that it comes not thence, is evident becauſe as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> obſerves, there were Women Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who were no more allow'd to Teach and Expound the Law under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than they are to Preach or Expound the Goſpel under the New; but if you derive it from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31614:70"/>the former Senſe of the Word, there are Women Phariſees ſtill, who are the chief Inſtruments and Supports of the Separation, and though they are but we ker Veſſels in the Church, are yet the main Props and Pillars of the Conventicle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You own the Phariſees to be a Sect, but withal add, That it was the moſt prevalent one; for the Phariſees (ſay you) were the Rulers of the Church, and the chief Members of the Sanhedrim. This is levell'd againſt the Church as if it were only a prevailing Sect or Faction. But, Sir,</p>
            <p>Is it not your great Ambition to be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and your great Uneaſineſs that 'tis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? May we not ſee a greedy thirſt and affectation of Power in ſome Men, who uſe all their Arts, and ſpare no Pains to arrive to it? And is not what they Malign and Envy in their Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Object of their own Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You own it to be not only a Sect, but the ſtrict Sect of the Phariſees, for they pretended (ſay you) to greater ſtrictneſs, than others: And is not this the Artifice, by which you ſeduce the unwary Vulgar, affecting a grave ſtarch'd Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration from the Civil Society of other Men, as if they were only Men of the Earth, and not fit for the Converſation of ſuch Heavenly Perſons? Yea, though our Saviour ſhew'd himſelf marvellouſly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable and converſable with all Mankind; yet you Quote two places from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to countenance your moroſe Diſtance.</p>
            <p>The one is, to <hi>Have no Fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.11.</note> which forbids only a Fellowſhip with the Vices, not with the Perſons of Men; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31614:71"/>is, <hi>Not to eat with Whoremongers and Adulterers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note> which is only a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt a too great and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Intimacy and Familiarity with ſuch Perſons, which all wiſe Men do adviſe againſt. But you go on.</p>
            <p>4thly, To deſcribe the Phariſees, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to ſtretch others to their Size: That they ſeparated from all others, but none muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them: This is another Arrow ſhot at the Church, not conſidering how it glances back, and wounds your own ſelves; for did not ſome Men not long ſince, labour hard to ſtretch others, to their new fangled Doctrin and Diſcipline? And though they not only ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from, but deſtroy'd the Eſtabliſh'd Church, yet none were to ſeparate from them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd by their bitter Invectives againſt Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which you ſhall have a larger Account, when you think fit to call it in Queſtion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</p>
            <p>5thly, The Phariſees (ſay you) diſtinguiſh'd themſelves from others, by their Garments; and ſuch too as ſignified a ſpecial Purity.</p>
            <p>This is a Fling at the Surplice, for its being us'd as a diſtinguiſhing Garb: But Sir, are not Judges and Magiſtrates in the Execution of their Office, diſtinguiſh'd from others by their Robes and Habits? And are the ſacred Offices of Religion, the only things that muſt be ſtripp'd naked, and diveſted of all decent Solemnity? The Phariſees Fault was, to place Holineſs and Purity in them; and yours is, to faſten Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs and Impurity upon them. But you go on,</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:31614:71"/>
            <p>6thly. The Phariſees were a proud domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Generation, ever gaping for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and aſpiring after the higheſt Places and Titles; to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and Lord it over the Faith and Conſciences of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>This is a fling at the Biſhops, for being call'd Lords; you had them before by the Lawn-Sleeves, and here you fall foul upon their Titles, that with the Phariſees they are not only for enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Philacteries, but with them too, they muſt be call'd <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and Lord it over God's Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But, Sir,</p>
            <p>Is all Superiority, in Place or Office, to be ſtil'd domineering? Is it impoſſible for any to be above others, without trampling upon all beneath them? Does not all Government require a Subordination? And what Order can be kept, if all Men ſtand upon the ſame Level? Muſt Pride, think you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily lurk under a Diſtinction of Habits and Titles? Nay, do not ſome, with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Pride of others, with far greater Pride of their own?</p>
            <p>This is too notorious to be deny'd; yea, does not your judging and cenſuring your Superiors imply an imaginary Superiority over them, and ſet you, in your own vain Conceit above them, as if they poor Souls! were all out of the way; and you want nothing but Place and Power to ſet them all right? What think you, is not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Pride and Inſolence? And yet you add, That you ſhould be ſorry, if the Non conformiſts ſhould do ſo.</p>
            <p>Sir, That they have done ſo, and far worſe things, too many have to their Sorrow found; who have groan'd under the Weight of their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31614:72"/>inſulting Power, and felt the little Finger of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery heavier than the Loins of Epiſcopacy. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more,</p>
            <p>7thly, When I told you of the falſe Gloſſes of the Phariſees, you own them to be looſe Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Law, and give an Inſtance of it, in their not making it to extend to the Internals of Religion, but to reach only the Outward Man, and to reſt in the External Obſervance of your Ceremonies and Traditions.</p>
            <p>This is intended for a Fling to the Ceremonies, as mere outſide formal things, that are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the inward Life and Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But,</p>
            <p>Sir, Is the Worſhip of God to be perform'd without any Ceremonies? If not, is it not much more comely, to behold Men joining and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in the ſame humble Poſtures of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, than to ſee them claſh and uſing different Words and Geſtures? Does not the Decency and Order requir'd by the Apoſtles, chiefly reſpect theſe things? Does not an Uniform and Regular way of ſerving God, add a Grace and Solemnity to Divine Worſhip? And is it not much better to ſerve him in the Beauty, than Deformity of Holineſs?</p>
            <p>The Phariſees Fault here again, was, to obſerve their Ceremonies and Traditions, with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Holineſs and Neceſſity, to look upon them as things as much commanded by God, as the great and weightier Matters of the Law: And yours likewiſe is to abſtain from innocent Ceremonies, with an Opinion of Sinfulneſs in them, and to eſteem them as things as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as the greateſt Breaches and Violations of God's Law. Now this is Superſtition both ways, and 'tis as much Will-worſhip in you, to ſay eat
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31614:72"/>not, taſte not, handle not the Holy Sacrament kneeling; as it was in the Phariſees to ſay, eat not, taſte not, handle not God's Creatures with unwaſhen Hands.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Church of <hi>England,</hi> looking on theſe Ceremonies, as merely indifferent and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumſtances of publick Worſhip, as you may ſee at large in the Preface before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer; and appointing them only for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Order and Decency, hath carefully avoided the Superſtition of both.</p>
            <p>And yet to keep up your Party, you tell the People, that we make them neceſſary and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Parts of Worſhip; and that you abſtain from them for the ſame Reaſon that Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles abſtain'd from the Ceremonies and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Phariſees, becauſe we place Holineſs and Religion in them.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is very foul play, at once to traduce the Church, and ſeduce the People; but to carry on your own Deſigns, you care not what falſe Game you play, or by what evil Arts and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations you compaſs them. But you go on and ſay,</p>
            <p>The Phariſees impos'd their Traditions and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as Laws, on Chriſt's Diſſenting Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and were ever accuſing and complaining of thoſe, that would not obſerve them.</p>
            <p>Here, after you had Aſpers'd the Church, you come to claw and flatter the Diſſenters, by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw in Chriſt and his Diſciples into the Number of them, and would make them as much Non-conformiſts and Separatiſts from the Jewiſh Church, as you are from the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But with how little Truth and Sincerity this is affirm'd, we may eaſily learn from the Hiſtory of the Four Evangeliſts; where we read, That
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31614:73"/>Chriſt and his Apoſtles liv'd in the Communion, and comply'd with the Ceremonies and Cuſtoms of the Jewiſh Church, from which the Phariſees were but a Sect, or Excreſcence.</p>
            <p>As for our Bleſſed Saviour, he was by Birth and Circumciſion a Member of the Church of the Jews, in both which Senſes,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> he is ſaid to be <hi>made under the Law:</hi> And being thereby a Debtor to keep the whole Law, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly paid an exact Duty and Conformity to it.</p>
            <p>In his Infancy, he was not only circumcis'd the Eighth Day, according to the Law given to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but was ſoon after preſented in the Temple, and his Mother purified, according to the Rites and Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>
            <p>When he was grown up, we read that he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Synagogues of the Jews every Sabbath Day:
<note place="margin">Luke 4.16.</note> For St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, That as his Cuſtom was, <hi>he went to the Synagogue on the Sabbath Day, and ſtood up for to read.</hi> Upon which Words, a very Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> vol. 1. page 1040.</note> That 'twas his conſtant Cuſtom to go to that Synagogue of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as his Pariſh Church, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath Day; where he ſometimes read him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and withal, join'd with the Congregation as a Member of it, in the other Parts of the Divine Service, adding, That he punctually obſerv'd all the Rites and Ceremonies of the Synagogue Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Yea, though the People of <hi>Nazareth</hi> were none of the beſt, as appears by that proverbial Speech, <hi>Can any Good come out of</hi> Nazareth? Yet he made no Separation, but continued a Member with them, till the Fear of his Life, and other Buſineſs of his Function call'd him thence: In his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31614:73"/>departing thence, having heal'd a Leper of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Leproſie,
<note place="margin">Matth. 8.4.</note> he bid him <hi>go and ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt, and offer the Gift due by the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>upon ſuch occaſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſhew the exact Conformity of Chriſt and his Apoſtles to the Jewiſh Church; we muſt note, That God Almighty appointed three great and memorable Feaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſover, Pentecoſt, and the Feaſt of Tabernacles, to be obſerv'd of all the Members of that Church: And leſt they ſhould think it ſufficient to do it by themſelves at home, in the particular Places of their abode, they were commanded to repair to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that not ſeverally and at different times, but to go up at the ſame times, and meet there together at the Celebration of thoſe great Feſtivals, which was done to tie them the faſter together in one Communion.</p>
            <p>Now the Evangeliſts frequently acquaint us, with Chriſt's reſorting to thoſe Feaſts: And the forecited Learned Author, after his recounting ſome of the many Ceremonies us'd at them, tells us, That Our Bleſſed Saviour was a punctual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of them all: And of the Apoſtles we read, that <hi>They were continually in the Temple, Bleſſing and Praiſing God,</hi> Luke 24.53.</p>
            <p>Again, we find our Saviour preſent at the Feaſt of the Dedication: And we read of the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> which were not of God's immediate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as the three former, but injoyn'd by Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Governors, in their ſeveral Ages.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we find Our Lord, in the Night in which he was Betrayed, taking the Paſſover with his Diſciples, and obſerving the Rites of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.19, 20. So that 'tis plain, that he both Liv'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31614:74"/>and Dyed in conſtant Communion with the Jewiſh Church.</p>
            <p>After his Reſurrection, when he had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and all the Types and Prophecies of the Old Law were accompliſh'd in him, by which he abundantly ſhew'd himſelf the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Meſſiah; he put an end to the Jewiſh Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and Inſtituted the Chriſtian Church, which he gave a Commiſſion to his Apoſtles to plant and propagate every where, and furniſh'd them with extraordinary Aſſiſtances and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt to that end.</p>
            <p>And this is that one Catholick Church, or Body of Chriſt, which Himſelf and his Apoſtles, would have kept entire without any Schiſm or Diviſion in it: To which end, they have left a ſtrict Charge upon all the Members of it, to <hi>Keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi> which can only be by joyning together in one Fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And now what think you, Sir, are Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to be reckon'd in the Number of Diſſenters and Non-conformiſts? Nay, have they not left an Example of ſtrict Conformity to the Jewiſh Church, of which they were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and ſhew'd an exact Compliance with all the Rights and Ceremonies, not only of Divine, but Humane and Eccleſiaſtical appointment us'd in it? And will our Saviour think you approve of Rents and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his own Body, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe things? No certainly, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to Unity, and the Prohibition of Diviſions are far more urgent under the Goſpel, than ever they were under the Law: And how can you conceive Schiſm and Separation to be ſigns of Grace and purer Chriſtianity, when they are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31614:74"/>ſo directly contrary to the Rules and Precepts of both?</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, Sir, that your additional Stroaks ſerve but to add to the Reſemblance, and your compleating the Character of the Phariſees, only ſhews you the more compleatly like them.</p>
            <p>But you have ſomething farther to ſay of the Phariſees Prayers, and ask, Whether they were by a Liturgy or not? Which muſt be examin'd and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my next. I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shew'd in my laſt, that the additional Stroaks, you gave to the Picture of the Phariſees, did but encreaſe the Reſemblance, and what you added to compleat their Character, ſerv'd only to make it look ſo much the harder upon you: I proceed in this to conſider what you have farther to ſay concerning your Prayers; and here, when I told, That the Phariſees Prayers were remarkable for two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> their length and their loudneſs, you very fairly quarrel with both; for your cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humour will ſcarce let any thing paſs: And therefore ſomething muſt be added for the Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both.</p>
            <p>As for their length, Our Saviour hath recorded it for a piece of their Hypocriſy,
<note place="margin">Matt. 23.14.</note> that they made long Prayers: No, (ſay you) 'twas not the length of their Prayers, but the making of them for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that is there blam'd.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, Did not the making of them for a pretence, imply an Opinion of ſome greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in them, than in ſhorter Prayers? Men are not wont to pretend to, but hide Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if the Phariſees made theſe Prayers for a Shew or Pretence, 'tis a ſign they took Prolixity for a Perfection and Orn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment of their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and plac'd greater Holineſs and Sanctity in them; that they had a value for long Prayers,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31614:75"/>and valu'd themſelves upon them, which was the thing I obſerved in them.</p>
            <p>As for their Lowdneſs, we read, That they pray'd in the Corners of the Street, which being done for Oſtentation and Vanity, and before great Concourſes of People, Lowdneſs was neceſſary to attain their Ends; and therefore as they ſounded a Trumpet before their Alms, that they might be ſeen of Men, ſo they lifted up their Voices like a Trumpet in their Street-prayers, to be heard of them.</p>
            <p>But whatever becomes of the Lowdneſs, you cannot away with blaming the length of Prayers; For was not <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, ſay you, a long Prayer? Yea, was not <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ſo?</p>
            <p>Sir, There are far more Examples of ſhort, than of long Prayers in Holy Scripture, and we read of much greater Succeſſes to have attended the one than the other: As for the Prayers you mention, the firſt of them, was but like one of our ſhort Collects, the other like our longer Forms, Compos'd for publick Faſts and Thankſgivings, but none of them like the tedious long-winded Harangues of <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer; beſides, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being the inſpir'd Prayers of the Prophets, and Dedicated by the Spirit of God upon ſome Solemn Occaſions, were both for Matter, and Words, ſound, pertinent and pithy. Whereas yours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſudden and haſty Conceptions of your own Brain, are far from either, being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times full of Impertinences, Tautologies and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs. But was not the Lord's a long Prayer (ſay you) when he continued all Night at it? And the Primitive Chriſtians ſpent ſometimes many hours together in Prayer; and ſome of their Faſts
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31614:76"/>were Celebrated with Prayers, prolong'd from the Morning of one Day, to the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Sir, 'Tis a great Miſtake to think, that they ſpent all this time in Verbal or Vocal Prayer, or that they were all this while ſpeaking and uttering Words unto God: No, a great part of this time was taken up in ſilent, and devout Soliloquies, in Pious, and Heavenly Meditations, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward breathings of Mental Prayer, which were very frequent, and made up a great part of the Devotion of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>As for our Saviour's continuing all Night in Prayer, much of that time was doubtleſs ſpent in the ſecret Elevations of the Heart; for we read of no other Words utter'd by him all that time, but <hi>O my Father! if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not my Will, but thine be done.</hi> The Diſciples were ſo far from joining with him, that they ſlept away the greateſt part of the Night; however, having utter'd theſe Words once, he awoke them, and pray'd again the ſecond time, <hi>O my Father, if this Cup may not paſs away from me, except I drink it, thy Will be done:</hi> After which he pray'd again the third time without any variation, ſaying the ſame Words: And with theſe few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varied Words, together with many inward Sighs, and Groans, that cannot be utter'd, he paſt that Night before his Sufferings with great Devotion, and hereunto the Apoſtle alludes, when he tells us of Chriſt's praying to his Father with ſtrong Cries and Tears. Beſides, Our Saviour having blam'd the Heathens for their much ſpeaking, and the Phariſees for their long Prayers, he was careful not to leave behind him an Example or Encouragement of either.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:31614:76"/>
            <p>As for what you ſay of the Primitive Chriſtians ſpending many Hours, and ſometime whole Nights in Prayer and Faſting; you muſt not think, that this was always done with the Voice or the Uſe of Words; for the ancient Fathers tell us, That a great part of their Service was perform'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with Silence, that is, with the inward Motions and Deſires of Mental Prayer, which are oftimes more acceptable with God, than the greateſt multitude or variety of Words.</p>
            <p>But you would have me tell you, whether the Phariſees long Prayers were by a Liturgy, or no? And if not, where is the Jewiſh Service, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles frequented? Adding, That you believe we ſhould find in thoſe Days no other Common-Prayer-Book, but the Bible.</p>
            <p>Sir, That the National Church of the Jews, had a publick Service, that was us'd in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Synagogues, is ſo plainly and fully prov'd by the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> that I ſhall need only to refer you to him: Where you may read ſome of the ſet Forms that Compos'd their Liturgy, together with the Order and Method of their whole Service, collected from the beſt and ancienteſt of the Jewiſh Writers. There you may learn likewiſe, that the Religion of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and Sadducees was not the National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Jews, in which Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles join'd, but Sects and Excreſcences from it, and being ſuch, we find our Saviour often reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but never communicating with them: And yet you will believe, that in thoſe Days there was no other Common-Prayer-Book, but the Bible, that is, you will believe againſt all the Senſe and Reaſon of the wiſeſt Men, and ſteer your Courſe againſt the ſtream of all Antiquity</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:31614:77"/>
            <p>But nothing ſticks ſo much in your Stomach, as charging the Phariſees with vain Babling, and you will never have done with repeating their vain Repetitions. What the Myſtery of this ſhould be is ſomewhat hard to gueſs, unleſs it be, That your Prayers being charg'd with the ſame fault, if you can clear the Phariſees Prayers from this Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may help to free yours from it, and ſet them off the better.</p>
            <p>But let thoſe take care (ſay you) how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Phariſees, who, in a Morning Service do, five or ſix times repeat the Lord's Prayer, and do ſo often cry, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> ſeven or eight times in the Litany, and <hi>We beſech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> one and twenty times.</p>
            <p>Sir, Is the frequent repeating the Lord's Prayer, which is the Pattern and Perfection of all our Prayers to be accounted vain Repetitions; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being us'd only upon different accounts and occaſions, as you may ſee in the Pious,
<note place="margin">Page 56.</note> and Learned Meditations of Dr. <hi>Comber;</hi> who asks, how we can too often join his perfect Prayer to ours, that are ſo imperfect, ſince by him alone, both we and our Prayers become acceptable? Again, is all Affectionate repeating, think you, of the ſame Words, to be thought vain Repetitions? Is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s repeating, <hi>His Mercy endureth for ever,</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix times in one Pſalm to be accounted ſuch? Or is Our Saviour's ſaying the ſame Words three times in his Agony, to be reckon'd in that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? No certainly, he that blam'd this fault in others, would not be guilty of it himſelf. For the clearing then of this Matter, I muſt ſhew you what are not vain Repetitions, and likewiſe what
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31614:77"/>are ſuch, that you may the better diſtinguiſh the one from the other. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, To repeat the ſame Words out of a deep Senſe of what we have receiv'd, and ardent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of what we ask at God's Hand, is no vain Repetition; thus the Pſalmiſt feeling an inward Joy in God's Mercy, and repeating it upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Occaſions was far from being vain: And much leſs was Our Saviour's ſaying the ſame Words, from a ſtrong Deſire of being heard, to be eſteem'd ſuch: Thus the doubling, and treb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Petitions for Mercy with Earneſtneſs and Affection is no vain Repetition: And yet this <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us,</hi> is never put up but three times together, which is a particular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to each of the Perſons in the Holy Trinity; and our putting up one and the ſame Petition thrice, denotes our praying to three Perſons, and one God, and I hope you will not think this a vain Repetition.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſame Words, when apply'd to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and freſh Matter, is no vain Repetition; thus that Form of Deprecation, <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> which you ſay is repeated ſix or ſeven times in the Litany, might look like a vain Repetition, if it were every time apply'd to one and the ſame thing; but being ſtill join'd to new Matter, that is, ſome different Sin or Calamity, from which we pray to be deliver'd, 'tis far from it: And the ſame may be ſaid of that Form of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> which being put up every time for ſome diſtinct Grace, or Mercy, cannot be reckon'd a vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhew'd you what are not vain Repetitions, and likewiſe freed our Church-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31614:78"/>from them, let us ſee what are ſuch, and how you can clear <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayers from them.</p>
            <p>Battology then, or vain Repetitions, is when Men think to be heard for their much ſpeaking, when too great a ſtreſs is laid upon the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and variety of Words: And this is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by a vain Opinion, That God is more pleas'd with long Prayers than ſhort; which puts Men upon lengthning their Prayers by varied Phraſes, to run out their Petitions into many Words, and to ask the ſame things in new and changeable Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Now this naturally leads to vain Repetitions, and they that too much affect this way, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall into them; and this is too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the <hi>Extempore</hi> Men, who many times pump hard for Matter and Words, and when theſe fail, fly to the Art of Variations, and piece out their Prayers with theſe vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But you obſerve another thing of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, that is, the place where they went to Pray, which you ſay was the Temple, the Synagogues, and other publick Places, as if the place were an infallible ſign of their Purity: And hereby you would reſemble our Prayers to theirs.</p>
            <p>Sir, Our publick Places of Worſhip, are with Our Bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Houſe of God, Dedicated, and ſet apart for that purpoſe; from whence Our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour whip'd the Buyers and Sellers that profan'd it.</p>
            <p>Whereas yours are in private Houſes, and Conventicles, where beſide other Fraud and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31614:78"/>there remain thoſe that make Merchandize of the People, and turn Huckſters of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing more that you blame in the Prayers of the Church, that is, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples reading half the Pſalms and Hymns, and ſaying almoſt half the Prayers, and being the only Petitioners in the far greater part of the Litany.</p>
            <p>But pray Sir, why may not the People join as well in reading as in ſinging the Pſalms and Hymns? Is there any difference in theſe things, with reſpect to God? Or is he more pleas'd or diſpleas'd, think you, with the one than the other? 'Tis Superſtition to think ſo, and therefore take heed of it.</p>
            <p>As for all ſuch Prayers, as relate to Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Abſolution, Benediction, Conſecration, or Adminiſtration of the Holy Sacraments, theſe being peculiar to the Miniſter's Office, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by him alone: But for ſuch other Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as relate to Confeſſion of Sin, the implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Grace, and the Aids and Aſſiſtances of a good Life, theſe concern the People as well as Prieſt, and may be perform'd by both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to unite their Affections and encreaſe their Fervency.</p>
            <p>Beſide, many Ancient Writers plainly teſtifie, That this Alternate way of praiſing God, was uſed from the Beginning, and hath continued down through all the Ages of the Church.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> lib. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, That the Chriſtians ſang their Hymns <hi>ſecum invicem,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately and by Parts. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is ſaid to have brought in this Uſage in the Church of <hi>Amioch.</hi> And many of the Fathers make mention of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31614:79"/>Uſe of Antiphones and Reſponſes in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which plainly proves not only the Ancient Uſe of Liturgies, but that the People bore a part in them.</p>
            <p>But my Sermon (ſay you) ſtiles the Miniſter the Mouth of the People, to make known their Requeſts unto God; and how is it agreeable with this and the Holy Scriptures, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſay half the Prayers, when we read or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily of no more than <hi>Amen</hi> to be ſaid by them?</p>
            <p>Sir, Though the Miniſter be truly ſaid to be the Mouth of the People, to offer up their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God, yet the People are requir'd to join with him, and with one Mind, and one Mouth, to glorifie their Maker: And how can this be done, if their Lips may not be open'd, nor their Mouth ſhew forth his Praiſe? And tho' we read, That he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, ſaid only <hi>Amen</hi> at the Prieſt's Bleſſing, or giving of Thanks, that is, at the Conſecration of the Holy Euchariſt; yet St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> tells us, That <hi>Populus cum Sacerdote loquitur in precibus,</hi> The People ſpeak with the Prieſt in the other Prayers.</p>
            <p>But the Women, ſaith a Brother of yours, are forbidden to ſpeak in the Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that part of the Congregation at leaſt, is debar'd from the <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>'s</hi> and <hi>Reſponſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, For the compoſing and directing of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for publick Worſhip, and likewiſe the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing the People, this way of ſpeaking being an Act of Authority, is peculiar to the Miniſter, and is forbidden to Women in the Church; but for joining in the Words of Confeſſion, and Supplication, this being an
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31614:79"/>Act of Humility and Subjection, is allow'd to the Female Sex, who have Sins to confeſs, and Souls to ſave as well as Men.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſider'd the Stroaks added to the Picture of the Phariſee: If they have rather marr'd, than mended the Matter, and only ſerv'd to ſhew you the Spots and Deformity of your Worſhip, you may thank your ſelf. I am</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Anſwer to mine of <hi>June</hi> 17th, brings you (you ſay) to the very Dregs of my Sermon. But why is that unſavoury Word to be given to a Sermon, eſpecially by one that is ſo great an Admirer of Preaching? Why, 'tis for bringing <hi>Extempore</hi>-Prayer from the very Dregs of Popery; which yet will not make it unſavoury in ſome Mens Noſtrils, tho' it came from the bottomleſs Pit.</p>
            <p>When to ſhew it a late Invention, I told you, that Antiquity makes mention only of two ways of Praying; the one by immediate Inſpiration, and the other by the uſe of publick Forms: You cry out, This is unparallel'd! What, is there no way of ſecret Ejaculatory Family Prayer, made mention of in Scripture, or Antiquity beſides theſe? But, Sir,</p>
            <p>You forget, That 'tis the ſolemn Prayers of publick Worſhip, that is the ſubject of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us, were in the Days of the Apoſtles, and ſome Ages after, perform'd by Inſpiration; and when that ceas'd, the Uſe of publick Forms hath been prov'd and deriv'd down ever ſince: So that what you ſay of Secret Ejaculatory Family Prayer, in which a greater Freedom hath been ever allow'd, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our Purpoſe, and all your Out cries thereupon, are both frivolous and impertinent.</p>
            <p>In your granting the Preliminaries, you own the creating and continuing Diviſions, to be one
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31614:80"/>of the principal Wiles of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries: But to ſalve the Credit of free Prayer, you would have Uniformity one of the main Tools they act by.</p>
            <p>Sir, Thoſe ſubtle Agents are too cunning to act with Tools, that are not fit and proper for the Work; they know well enough, that joining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame Forms and Way of Worſhip, is the beſt means to promote Peace and Unity, which is none of their Buſineſs; and they never hope to make that an Inſtrument of Diviſion any other way, than by diſparaging and deſtroying it; they have found by Experience, that free Prayer is the proper Tool for their Work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have been whetting that, and their Wits too to promote it, as the beſt Engine they can work by.</p>
            <p>But is not the New Uniformity (ſay you) a ſtanding Evidence, and Occaſion of our Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Yes; but how? Why juſt as our Bleſſed Saviour is ſaid to bring not Peace on Earth, but a Sword: Which muſt not be underſtood, as if the Goſpel of Chriſt had any natural Tendency to War and Diſturbance, but that Mens corrupt Natures and Deſigns would take Occaſion from thence to fall into them: Neither is there any Tendency in Uniformity to create, but extinguiſh Diviſions; and yet ſuch is the Depravation and Perverſeneſs of ſome Mens Natures, as to turn Antidotes into Poiſon, and make the very Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Peace become the Engines of Diſcord.</p>
            <p>But you cannot believe the Stories of <hi>Cummin</hi> and <hi>Heth;</hi> Why ſo? Can any Matter of Fact be confirm'd with better Evidence, the one from the Memorials of the Queen's Council-board, and the other from the Records of a Biſhop's See? You would believe any thing that made for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31614:81"/>free Prayer upon half the Evidence; a little glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Light peeping through a cranny, can ſhew you the Excellency, but the brighteſt Light of Noon-Day can't make you ſee the Danger and Deformity of it. Is not this groſs Partiality?</p>
            <p>But 'tis a Myſtery (ſay you) that theſe Stories ſhould not come abroad, till about 120 Years after the Matter of Fact. Sir,</p>
            <p>Have not ſome Truths ſlept much longer, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when there was no Occaſion for awaking them? The Diviſions at that time, and long after, were but few and inconſiderable, and there was little or no Dread or Danger of them, which might make theſe and other Paſſages of like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, paſs away unobſerved; but when Diviſions came to multiply, and by the encreaſe of Sects to threaten the Government, the common Safety put Men upon a farther Search into the Riſe of them, to obſerve what was before neglected; and Divine Providence, for wiſe ends, may bring ſome things to light, which had lain a while and ſlept in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the Doctor who publiſh'd theſe things, had a Fire brand in his Tail: Why ſo? Why for ſhewing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> the Riſe and Progreſs of thoſe Diviſions, whence they came, and whither they tend; and cautioning them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Evil and Miſchief of them: And is it not better to cry Fire, to prevent the Danger, than ſilently ſuffer it to ſpread, and put a whole Kingdom into a Combuſtion?</p>
            <p>And yet your reading of Fire and Sword through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Book, renders, ſay you, the Stories the more ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Sir, There is no Fire or Sword in that Book, that tends to deſtroy, but (like the flaming Sword that guarded Paradiſe) ſerves only to defend both Church and Country, and all the Heat you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31614:81"/>of in that Learned Doctor, ſeems to be no other than a Zeal, to ſhew the Cauſe and Cure of our Diviſions, which elſe may not only inflame, but conſume us; and this, one would think, ſhould rather incline, than hinder you from the Belief of it.</p>
            <p>But you farther doubt the Truth of theſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, from my Inconſiſtence in relating of them; for you have two Accounts (you ſay) of mine concerning this Matter, in which there is ſome Difference.</p>
            <p>Sir, The firſt of theſe was a private Paper, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſign'd for the Preſs, and written when I had not the Book by me, nor any Opportunity of examining the Matter and Circumſtances of the Fact; the other is Printed upon a full and due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the whole.</p>
            <p>Now, Which of theſe, think you, ſhould give you the Meaſures in this Relation? Or who would lay any Streſs, yea, ſo much as mention ſuch an imperfect and ſuppreſs'd Paper, that had not ſome By-end to ſerve in ſo doing? So that this is a mere Cavil, and only betrays ſome feeble Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſupport a ſinking Cauſe, that muſt catch at ſuch ſlender Twigs to keep it up.</p>
            <p>But the World (ſay you) is full of Shams, and deſigning Perſons have ſelfiſh Projects to carry on. But is there no Truth in the World, becauſe there are many Shams and Falſhoods? And is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be believ'd, becauſe the Credit of too many things is ſupported by falſe Evidence and ſelfiſh Projects? This, Sir, will run you into all Scepticiſm, and make you not only doubt, but deny the beſt atteſted Relations in any kind, and therefore take heed of it.</p>
            <p>But don't you, in the following Words, very fairly arraign the Government, by aſſerting the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity to be the Spring of all the Diſcord,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31614:82"/>Perſecution and Distraction the Nation hath groan'd under? And that the King and Parliament were acted by ſham Plots, and ſcandalous Intrigues in making it:</hi> Theſe are bold Speeches; for which, I leave you to be accountable to your Superiors. Only I muſt obſerve, what a ſeeming Pleaſure you take in talking of Plots, and making uſe of them to ſerve your own ends, which ſhews your good Will to the Government, if it act not juſt as you would have it.</p>
            <p>But at laſt, you will grant that the Monks and Jeſuits have too ſucceſsfully acted their Parts, and play'd their Games among all Parties: Why then will you not believe this Matter of Fact before us, when ſcarce any of their doings hath been more plainly prov'd or more faithfully recorded? It ſeems you can believe any thing that makes for your Purpoſe and Intereſt, but nothing againſt it; and the true Reaſon of this Incredulity of yours in this Matter, is not the want of ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but becauſe you have no Mind to believe it.</p>
            <p>What follows this for a Page or two, are ſuch rude Clamors and Calumnies againſt Kings, Biſhops, Prieſts, and all conformable Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I cannot think fit to waſte Ink or foul Paper in tranſcribing them, and much leſs to waſte Time in replying to them.</p>
            <p>When you had thus vented your Spleen, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, p. 162. to renew your Diffidence, and deny that Popiſh Emiſſaries introduc'd free Prayer into theſe Kingdoms, tho' you own they us'd and abus'd it, and did many as bad and worſe things; yet whatever you think, you will not believe, that ſo good a thing as free Prayer, ſhould have ſo bad an Original.</p>
            <p>After this, to ſhew that you cannot ſpeak or think of this with any Patience, that the Idol of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31614:82"/>free Prayer, by which all your Conventicles are ſupported, ſhould be thus abus'd; you fall again into another Fit of raving and railing Rhetorick, opening your foul Mouth, and belching out many falſe and impudent Accuſations againſt many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Learned Men; acting the ſame part with <hi>Heth</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> in reviling the Liturgy as a Tranſlation of the Maſs, and crying up free Prayer as the only Spiritual way of Praying, to continue the Impoſture on the People; which ſort of Ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry continues to the end of the Letter, which is ſo far from needing or deſerving any Anſwer, that 'tis fit only to be doom'd to Eternal Silence; and 'twere but juſt to ſtop the Mouths of ſuch as utter it.</p>
            <p>And yet in the Cloſe of the Letter, as if you had a Patent for reviling, and would engroſs the Honor of being the Accuſer of the Brethren, you gravely caution me againſt reproaching the Church, for which as I know no Cauſe; ſo you may aſſure your ſelf, there is no Fear from</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN your Reply to my Letter concerning Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> the firſt thing you fall foul upon, is the Order of Biſhops, and queſtion whether it be an Order diſtinct from and ſuperior to Presbyters, <hi>Jure Diviro;</hi> looking upon it as a great Grievance, that you ſhould be requir'd to give your Aſſent and Conſent to it.</p>
            <p>Sir, That Chriſt appointed two diſtinct Orders of Miniſters in his Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Seventy Diſciples, is a Matter too evident in Holy Scripture to be deny'd; for they are every-where diſtinguiſh'd from each other, and rank'd under different Names and Titles, which they would not be, if there were no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them; for which, ſee St. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 13. <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>That the Office of the Twelve was not only diſtinct from, but ſuperior to that of the Seventy, is no leſs apparent from the Order in which they are reckon'd; for the Apoſtles are always plac'd and rank'd before the other, <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11.</note> ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtors, and ſome Teachers;</hi> and elſewhere,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>He gave firſt Apoſtles, and ſecondarily Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> where <hi>Firſt</hi> ſignifies not only the Order of Time, but the Order of Dignity and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Apoſtles not only preſided over, but appointed, ruled, and directed the other: And as the Apoſtles died, ſome of the Seventy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31614:83"/>were elected into their Number, and advanc'd to their place, as <hi>Matthias</hi> was into the place of <hi>Judas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 1.26.</note> which muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Primacy of Order, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Apoſtolical Office; for the preferring another is never to the ſame or worſe Station, but always to ſomething higher and better, than he was in before: But here you are wont to ſay, <hi>That though the Apoſtles were ſuperior to the Seventy in Office, yet not in Power and Juriſdiction.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Sir, Does not a Superiority in Office, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply a Superiority of Power, without which, 'tis no better than an empty Name? Hath not every Office ſome degree of Power annex'd to it? And when any is advanc'd to an higher Office, does he not exerciſe a Power in things, which he had no Authority to do before? This is too obvious to be gain-ſaid: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt not the Apoſtolical Office, to which ſome of the Seventy were wont to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, be neceſſarily accompanied with ſome higher Degrees of Authority and Juriſdiction? For elſe, they were advanced to nothing when they were elected or promoted to it; 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, they ſucceeded only to what they had before: And what would the Apoſtolical Office over other Church-Officers ſignifie, if they had no Power to overſee and govern them?</p>
            <p>But that the Apoſtles both had, and exercis'd a Power over them, the Holy Scripture and Primitive Antiquity may abundantly ſatisfie you</p>
            <p>For, we find St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, and firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not only preſiding in the great Council held there, but likewiſe by his own Authority deciding the Matters debated in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31614:84"/>it, about the Gentil Converts, ſpeaking in that commanding Style, <hi>It ſeemeth goood to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> to lay upon them no greater Burdens, than theſe neceſſary things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after which we find <hi>Timothy</hi> Ordain'd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.3.</note> and exerciſing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Juriſdiction over that Church,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.1.</note> which extended over all the proconſular <hi>Aſia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 9.11.5.22.</note> in which he commanded that the Laity be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inſtructed, the Clergy provided with a competent Maintenance, admitting none to be Deacons, but upon due Examination, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining none to be Elders or Presbyters, till they had well-perform'd the Office of a Deacon, receiving Accuſations againſt them, and putting guilty Perſons to an open Shame; all which, are Acts of Power and Juriſdiction. Again,</p>
            <p>We find <hi>Titus left in</hi> Crete, <hi>to ſet in Order the things that were wanting, and to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders in every City:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> By which it appears, That he had an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power confer'd upon him, to do that in <hi>Crete,</hi> which the Presbyters that were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had not; and this Power extended not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſetting in order what was wanting, and the ordaining of Elders, but likewiſe to the rebuking of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders with all Authority;
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.15.</note> firſt, admoniſhing them, and if they perſiſted in their Obſtinacy, puniſhing them with the Cenſures of the Church,
<note place="margin">Chap. 3.10.</note> and rejecting them from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it, which are all Acts of Power and Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>But this Power (ſay ſome) was only Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and to laſt no longer, than the Days of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31614:84"/>the Apoſtles, who were the firſt Planters of theſe Churches. Why ſo? Was there not the ſame Uſe and Neceſſity of theſe things in the following Times, as there was in the Days of the Apoſtles? Is there not a conſtant need of ordaining Elders, and exerciſing Diſcipline and Cenſures in the ſucceeding Ages of the Church, as well as the firſt? Again, where hath Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited this Power, and made it Temporary? Yea, hath he not plainly made it perpetual, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to be with them to the End of the World? Which could not be with them in their own Perſons, who died in a little Time after, but with them in their Succeſſors, who follow'd them in their Office, to whom the ſame Promiſe of Aſſiſtance, and Encouragement is given to the End of the World. Beſide,</p>
            <p>Does not Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory give us a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account who ſucceeded them in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches? A Catalogue of whom you may find in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and many other Writers: So that nothing in Antiquity is more plain, than that the Apoſtles had a Power over others, for the well-ordering and governing the Church, and that this Power was deriv'd down to their Succeſſors the Biſhops, who have exercis'd the ſame in the ſeveral Ages of the Church ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Which Form of Government being firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt, and ſeconded by the Practice of his Apoſtles, and ſucceeded to in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches by our Saviour's expreſs Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, is abundantly enough to make it an Order diſtinct from, and ſuperior to Presbyters, <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> and conſequently, there is little Reaſon why you ſhould think it a Grievance to aſſent and conſent to that, which the Chriſtian Church hath in all Ages aſſented and conſented to.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:31614:85"/>
            <p>But here you fly to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and would know what I think of that and other Countries, that have caſt off the Government of the Church by Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Sir, Though I have no Inclination to meddle with the Affairs of any other Church; yet ſince the Importunity of your Argument requires an Anſwer, I muſt tell you, That as particular Perſons and Bodies of Men, may be guilty of Schiſm, by breaking off from the Communion and Diſcipline of a National Church; ſo a whole Nation or Country may be juſtly charg'd with it in breaking off from the Communion and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Catholick Church, of which that is a Member.</p>
            <p>And this is the unhappy Caſe of your beloved <hi>Scotland,</hi> which by caſting off the Ancient, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical and Primitive Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, by Biſhops, and likewiſe by laying aſide a Liturgy or Forms of Prayer for publick Worſhip, both which having been received in the Chriſtian Church ever ſince its firſt Eſtabliſhment, is thereby become Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: For by ſo doing, it hath cut it ſelf off from the One Body of the Catholick Church, and is become no longer a ſound Part of it, but a Sect and Excreſcence of it.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, what then, will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the Inhabitants of that Country, as living in the Grievous and Damning Sin of Schiſm?</p>
            <p>No, Sir, There were ſome who voluntarily and violently, acted to the laying aſide the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy and Epiſcopacy in that Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wilfully brake the Communion, Worſhip, and Diſcipline of the Chriſtian Church, and theſe are truly and properly guilty of the hainous
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31614:85"/>Sin of Schiſm; which if not repented of, and amended in Time, will prove as fatal to them heareafter, as 'tis to the Church here: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe,</p>
            <p>There are many Thouſands in that diſtracted Kingdom, who abhorr'd and endeavour'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that wide and miſerable Breach in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church: But being over-power'd, were forc'd to ſee and bewail that miſerable Rent made in it, and can only wiſh and pray for the Peace and Repairs of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now theſe are no ways to be charg'd with the Guilt of this Schiſm; for here the Succeſſion being altogether involuntary, 'tis to be reckon'd their Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but not their Fault: And the like may be ſaid of the Inhabitants of ſome other Countries, who being by the Misfortune of Times and Place, depriv'd of that way of Worſhip and Diſcipline, that ſhould unite them to the Catholick Church, may not be charg'd with that Schiſm, which they could neither foreſee nor prevent; but being by una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Neceſſity brought under it, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will have Mercy upon them, and make up that in the Ever-bleſſed Society of Saints hereafter, which they want of the Communion of Saints here.</p>
            <p>But do you not ſee (ſay you) in the Letter of <hi>June</hi> 28th, how thoſe whoſe Turn it is to be the Eſtabliſh'd Church in that Kingdom, may turn their own Artillery upon you, and talk to your diſaffected Brethren in the ſame ſtrain, as you do to us; and tell them, That all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and Diviſions of that Church, are to be put upon the ſcore of their Diſobedience? May'nt they be Characteriz'd for ſtubborn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Schiſmaticks, as we now are? No, Sir, 'tis one thing to ſtick to the truly Ancient,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31614:86"/>Primitive, and Apoſtolical Diſcipline and way of Worſhip, and another to ſet up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote new upſtart Ways and Models in both; the one is to endeavour to keep the Unity of the Church, and the other to break it. Now in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that prevailing Party that laid aſide the ancient Diſcipline and Worſhip of the Catholick Church, to ſet up thoſe new-fangl'd Models, are truly branded for Schiſmaticks, for breaking into different Factions and Communions, whereby they divide the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and may be juſtly ſaid to create Diſtractions and Diviſions in the Church, whereas they who adher'd to the ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin and Diſcipline of the Catholick Church, and would willingly have preſerv'd both; theſe can no ways be charg'd with the Schiſms and Diviſions of that Church, for theſe differ as much from the other, as the Keepers of the Peace do from the Breakers of it: And you know, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to charge the ſame Diſorders and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, upon thoſe that endeavour to keep the Peace, as upon thoſe who make it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to break it; ſo that the Artillery you ſpeak of, ſtill points to you, and cannot be turn'd upon thoſe againſt whom you level it.</p>
            <p>But it may be your Caſe (ſay you) in another Century, if any thing happen to be requir'd, which you think unlawful, to fall under the like Difficulties of the Government.</p>
            <p>Sir, That there is nothing unlawful requir'd in the preſent Government, I ſuppoſe you are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well ſatisfied; and therefore your Schiſm, in theſe Circumſtances, is both unreaſonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable: And 'tis to be hoped, That the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will in no Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, either voluntarily and cauſeleſly cut off
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31614:86"/>ſelves, or be violently cut off by any others, from the Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church: But if it ſhould ſo happen (which God forbid) our Duty will be, not to applaud, but lament the Schiſm, to enjoy as much as we may of the Communion of the Church, and to pray and wait for a better Union, and fuller En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it.</p>
            <p>But there is one Objection more urg'd by your Party, againſt the Authority of Biſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Biſhops Power be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> how come they to execute it by Lay-Chancellors?</p>
            <p>Sir, Beſide the Spiritual Power committed to Biſhops, as Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, Church-Cenſurers, Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are executed by themſelves in Perſon, there are other things <hi>Circa Spiritualia,</hi> which are by Law committed to their Care and Inſpection, as the Cognizance of Wills and Teſtaments, many Caſes about Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Alimony and Divorce, about Tithes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapidations, Defamation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many intricate Caſes, and requiring more time than the Biſhop can well ſpare, from the weightier Duties of his Office, he is impower'd to commiſſion one Learned in the Canon and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws, to hear and determine ſuch Matters; ſo that as <hi>Moſes</hi> did appoint inferior Officers and Judges to determine ſmall Matters, whilſt the weightier things were brought to him: So the Biſhop by the Allowance of the Church, is permitted to have theſe Officers under him, to take off part of his Burden in ordinary Matters, and to diſpatch ſome of his Buſineſs, when he is otherwiſe employ'd or hinder'd.</p>
            <p>But you publiſh (ſay you) ſuch Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are decreed by Lay-Chancellors, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Canon.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:31614:87"/>
            <p>And why not? For though the Lay-Chancellors, by the Authority of the Biſhop, may decree the Sentence for not hearkning to the Church; yet being an Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, 'tis never executed by him, but either by the Biſhop in Perſon, or ſome other Spiritual Perſon, that hath full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to do it; and when this Cenſure is thus regularly decreed and pronounc'd, why may we not publiſh it, that others may know and avoid them, and according to our Saviour's Order, look upon them <hi>as a heathen Man and a Publican?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have conſider'd your main Objections, concerning the Order of Biſhops. What you farther offer concerning Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in my next. I am</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN your Letter concerning Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> after a few flings and reflections upon the Order of Biſhops, which I endeavour'd to rectifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move in my laſt. You tell me, That you are far better pleas'd with ſome Biſhops, than we think you are, and particularly inſtance in Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> wiſhing there were many Hundreds more of them in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe Reverend Perſons are much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, that you have not ſo great an Averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them as to ſome others; But what is the Reaſon of this great Kindneſs to thoſe Excellent Men? Why, ſome By-End to be ſure, for 'tis not out of any Reſpect to their Order; which you will not allow to be diſtinct from, nor Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Presbyters; No, nor yet for their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great Abilities in deciding Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion, for you are not like (you ſay) to refer to their final Deciſion, any Matters in Debate between us in their preſent Conſtitution: Whence then ſhould this Honourable Eſteem of yours for theſe Great Men proceed? Why, this you will tell me in the next Words, 'twas for their Exemplary Piety, diſcover'd by their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in Preaching, and likewiſe for their great Temper and Moderation in Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:31614:88"/>
            <p>As for their Exemplary Piety that was chiefly ſeen in their Pious Lives, and Zealous adhereing to the Eſtabliſh'd Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and likewiſe by ſticking as cloſe and as long as they could to the Primitive Diſcipline and Government of that Church: But you paſs by theſe Eminent, and Exemplary Inſtances of their Piety, becauſe they do not ſerve your purpoſe, and inſtead of them, take notice of their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in Preaching, and their great Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now, though painfulneſs in Preaching be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very good Commendation in all that are call'd to it, yet I think a Vigilant care, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in ruling well the Church of God, and ſetting in order things that are wanting in it, is a more neceſſary and commendable Qualification of a Biſhop; and indeed, if you will rightly conſider the multitude, weight and difficulty of the Buſineſs that appertains to their Office, you will find it enough to employ the Time and Thoughts of the ableſt Overſeer. Beſides,</p>
            <p>The Biſhops having generally ſpent their Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Years in painful Preaching, and being ſeldom advanc'd to that Office, till they come to their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Years, may by reaſon of the decay of Strength and Voice, and other Infirmities that attend that Age, be excus'd from that painfulneſs, and may more uſefully employ the Time, and Experience of thoſe Years, in well-governing the Church, over which they are appointed Overſeers: But if any beſide their other Work have ſtrength and leiſure enough for this Exerciſe, they may, and ought to make uſe of it, and you know ſome Time is by our Reverend Biſhops very frequently and profitably employ'd this way.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:31614:88"/>
            <p>Your next Commendation of thoſe Reverend Fathers, is their Temper, and Moderation in Eccleſiaſtical Matters: Now this, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is an Excellent Vertue, and a very uſeful and neceſſary Qualification, of all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors both in Church and State; But how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this is miſtaken and miſ-apply'd, I ſhew'd you in a former Letter on that Subject, and I fear we ſhall find ſomething of it in the preſent Caſe, as may be eaſily gather'd from what you relate of theſe great Men, concerning the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Prayers of the Church: For the better clearing whereof, you muſt Note,</p>
            <p>That 'twas the misfortune of thoſe two great Prelates, to live in very bad Times, when the Liturgy, and Epiſcopacy (of both which they were ſtrong Aſſerters) were laid aſide, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both the ancient Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Church turn'd out of Doors; now thoſe two Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Learned Biſhops, not only lamented the miſerable Rents and Ruins made in the Church by this means, but endeavour'd to repair, and keep up as much of it, as in that broken State of things they could: And this was the occaſion of that Model of Primitive Epiſcopacy, drawn up by Arch-biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> of which you make ſo frequent mention; and the ſame was the occaſion of that Moderator mention'd by Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> to ſupply the place of the Biſhop, the deſign of both which was to preſerve ſo much of the Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction belonging to the Primitive Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as thoſe unhappy Times would admit of, and like Men in a Storm, when they could not ſave all, to ſave as much as they might. Now this, Sir, proceeded not from any ſuch coldneſs and indifferency towards the Order, as you vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, and miſcal Moderation, but from an
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31614:89"/>earneſt and affectionate Zeal to preſerve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it.</p>
            <p>As for what you alledge from Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of your Faults of Conſiſtorial Officers, that was deſign'd not to remove, but reform their Courts, to take away all juſt Exceptions againſt them, that the People might be the better recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the Order, and yield the more ready O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Authority and Juriſdiction annex'd to it; for if you would have Courts of Juſtice laid aſide for the Abuſes of ſome Under-officers in them, you might ſoon reform away all Civil, as well as Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhew'd you the Judgment of thoſe two Reverend Prelates concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church: You would have me next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Sentiments as to Prayer; and here you grant, that as he us'd, ſo he vindicated the Liturgy; but you never met with a Word (ſay you) to juſtifie the impoſing it, and no other, in plublick Prayer.</p>
            <p>Sir, Hath not the Liturgy been impos'd ever ſince the Reformation, and no other for publick Worſhip? And was it not the deſign of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his Vindication of it, to perſwade all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to uſe and joyn in it as ſo impos'd? Is not the faithful and conſtant reading of the Prayers, one main Article of enquiry in all Epiſcopal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations? And did this Pious Biſhop think you, neglect ſo weighty a Part and Duty of his Office? No, Sir, he very diligently and devoutly us'd the Liturgy himſelf, and ſtrictly kept his Clergy to it, till the Iniquity of the Times put an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome ſtop to both, from whence he betook himſelf to conceiv'd Forms of Prayer, to ſupply the want of the other, the only expedient to fly to in thoſe perilous Times. That this was his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31614:89"/>you may gather from his own Words, for he tells us, that he us'd the ſame liberty in Prayer, that he did in Preaching; ſo that as his Sermons were Compos'd, ſo were his Prayers too: That the former were ſo, the Elegance and Exactneſs of them may eaſily ſatisfie you; and that he took as much care in ſpeaking to God in Prayer, as he did to the People in Preaching, you may learn from the Reverence he ſtill bore to the Divine Majeſty, which kept him to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Advice of <hi>not being raſh with his Mouth, or haſty to utter any thing before God:</hi> So that for your <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> Effuſions, or pouring out preſent and ſudden Conceptions, we never find it us'd or commended by him.</p>
            <p>And is it wiſe or fit think you, to alledge the Salvo's and Expedients of bad Times for Precedents in good ones; and to make Caſes of Neceſſity Rules of Duty and Practice, when that Neceſſity ceaſes? 'Twas the Grief of thoſe Pious and Learned Prelates, to ſee thoſe woful Breaches made in the Government and Service of the Church, which they labour'd to their uttermoſt to prevent and heal; and had they liv'd to ſee Epiſcopacy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to its full Power, and the Liturgy to its ancient Uſe and Practice, they would no doubt have Bleſſed God for that happy Day; and with good Old <hi>Simeon</hi> ſung their <hi>Nunc Dimittis,</hi> and would then willingly depart in Peace, when their Eyes had ſeen the Church ſetled again in Peace, upon the Ancient and Primitive Foundation.</p>
            <p>But the good Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> (ſay you) was no Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer of the Times. No, Sir, the Hardſhips and Sufferings he underwent by them, plainly ſhew him to be no favourer or flatterer of thoſe Times. His ſteady Zeal to the King and the Church kept him from all baſe Compliances with the Enemies of both. But</p>
            <pb n="158" facs="tcp:31614:90"/>
            <p>You bring a very awkard Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove his Integrity,
<note place="margin">This is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Print.</note> taken from ſome paſſionate Speeches that paſt between him and another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that was after his Metropolitan, which is rather a Blemiſh than Ornament to his Reputation; and ſhews what a worthy commender you are of Good Men, to ſingle out the worſt Paſſages of their Lives, to preſerve their Memory, and to make uſe of their Failings to adorn their Character.</p>
            <p>But you would fain know how it comes to paſs, That conceiv'd Prayer ſhould be ſo pious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing in Private, and yet ſo pernicious, and dangerous a Device when us'd in Publick. Sir,</p>
            <p>The Reaſon hereof is obvious, for conceiv'd Prayer in the retirements of Cloſet, where they are ſhut up from the Eyes and Ears of others, can have no Vanity, or Worldly deſign in it; but being tranſacted only between God and the Soul, is generally an Argument and Inſtance of great Sincerity, and here the broken Sighs and Language of a Contrite Heart prove oftentimes the moſt prevailing Oratory.</p>
            <p>Whereas the pouring out many and new Words in publick, may be and often is accompanied with Oſtentation, and other Secular Ends. You know the Phariſees made ſuch long Prayers for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be heard and ſeen of Men, the better to carry on their Rapine and Oppreſſions; and too many uſe them ſtill for a Shew of greater San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and a Cloak to hide their viler Practices: You cannot be ignorant, that this way of Praying hath been and ſtill is a great Inſtrument and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Diviſion, and is made the principal Device of all Teachers to draw Diſciples after them.</p>
            <p>But how is it conſiſtent (ſay you) to commend free Prayer in private, and yet too, affirm, That
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31614:90"/>upon the ceaſing of Inſpiration, Godly Forms were appointed both for publick and private Devotion?</p>
            <p>Very well, Sir, for in the publick Aſſemblies, Forms are neceſſary, that all People may know their Prayers, and ſo Pray with the Underſtanding: And likewiſe in private Families, where many are to joyn, Forms are expedient for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and both theſe ſince the ceaſing of Inſpiration, are beſt perform'd this way: But in the more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſecret Devotions of the Cloſet, free Prayer may be conveniently uſed, becauſe thereby every one may better deſcend to his own particular Wants and Failings, than by any Form Compos'd by others, who cannot be ſo well acquainted with theſe things, as themſelves. So that theſe things rightly conſider'd, may very well conſiſt together, and each of them may have their proper time and place.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have throughly conſider'd all that is material in your Letters, and have not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted any thing, that either needs or deſerves an Anſwer: It remains, that I conſider what you add in the Cloſe, againſt the Account I gave of Biſhop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> and the Deſign of his Book, which ſhall be done in the next.

            <head>LETTER XXII.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my Anſwer to what you alledg'd from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s Gift of Prayer; I told you the Deſign of that Book, by the Author's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was a mere Novelty, and thence took Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mind you of the Danger of New In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Innovations in Religion. Now to this</p>
            <p>You reply, <hi>This is very important Doctrin! Which would have kept Chriſtianity out of the World, and the Pope with all his deteſtable Enormities in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Sir,</p>
            <p>Is Reforming, think you, Innovating? Did our pious and learned Reformers make a New Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or only reſtore the Old? They were wiſe enough to know and diſtinguiſh between theſe; and therefore threw aſide only the Hay and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſome cunning Architects had built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundation of Chriſtianity, but ſtill kept the Old Foundation and Fabrick of it: And would this have kept Chriſtianity out of the World? Yea, is not this the beſt way to keep it in it, which elſe would be buried and loſt in Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh and Ruin?</p>
            <p>Again, Our wiſe Reformers caſt out only the corrupt Additions, and Innovations of Popery, but retain'd all that was truly Ancient, Primitive, and Apoſtolical; and is this the way to keep the Pope with all his deteſtable Enormities in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Would you have them lay aſide the Gold and precious Stone, together with the Hay and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31614:91"/>Stubble? And having thus wiſely rejected their gray-headed Novelties, ſhall we receive Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a latter Date, under a Pretence of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advance and Progreſs in Reformation? This, Sir, is either a Cavil, or a plain Miſtake of the Nature and Rule of Reformation.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph, when I told you, there was no Uſe or Need of this Artificial Gift, all Chriſtian Churches performing their publick Worſhip by ſet preſcrib'd Forms:</p>
            <p>To this you reply, <hi>Is it not ſtill a Wonder, that this Learned Man ſhould ſo far forget Antiquity and himſelf, as to be at ſuch Pains about an uſeleſs and needleſs Gift?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, That Learned Man did not ſo much forget Antiquity, as conſider the Times in which he wrote, which was when a prevailing Faction had laid aſide the Ancient and beſt Way of publick Prayer, by preſcribed Forms: Nor was his Artificial Gift either uſeleſs or needleſs at that time, when he took that Pains about it, being perhaps, the beſt Expedient that could be thought of to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Want of preſcrib'd Forms, and to keep up true Devotion amidſt the Irreverence and great Indecencies of thoſe Times. And as for what you ſay of loſing his Memory; he not only retain'd his own, but aſſiſted others, by directing to the beſt way of Praying, when Forms were gone.</p>
            <p>But how does it appear (ſay you) That that great Man ſaw the bad Effects of this new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment in Divinity, and look'd upon it as an Inſtrument of Diviſion? Sir,</p>
            <p>I hope you will allow that great Light of the Church, to ſee that which every body elſe ſees and knows; for is there any thing more viſible, than that this is that Idol and Support of all our Sectaries? Is not a Liturgy the great ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:31614:92"/>Block, that keeps many weak, ſeduced Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Church? And free Prayer the Bait that allures them to the Conventicle? And are not all our Divſions founded upon, and upheld by this Artificial Gift and Practice?</p>
            <p>But where, and when (ſay you) did he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, or retract this Book? Sir,</p>
            <p>If there were no other way, he effectually did it by his own Practice, which is a far better way of doing it, than any Words or Writings: For Actions ſpeak louder than Words; Men may, and often do, ſpeak one thing and think another, and their Practices are a plain Confutation of their Principles; but Actions ſeldom lye, and the Courſe of Mens Lives are the beſt and trueſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their Minds.</p>
            <p>Now, did not this great Man, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the Church, plainly abandon this Art, which ſhew'd his Senſe of the Imperfection of it; and betook himſelf to the Uſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgy, which ſhew'd that his Judgment carried him to that, as much better? This you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny without diſparaging the Memory of that great Man, nor grant without diſparaging this Artificial Gift, which is a Strait I muſt leave you to get out of as well as you can.</p>
            <p>But the Deſign of this worthy Man (ſay you) was not merely to help the Memory, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Affections, improve the Judgment, and promote the Conſolation and Edification of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: And there is no doubt to be made of this, for his helping the Memory by mental Forms, when Book-Forms were remov'd, was chiefly to promote thoſe ends, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſiſt them to pray heartily and affectionately with Judgment, and to the Edification of themſelves and others: And to this end, advis'd them againſt long and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:31614:92"/>varied Prayers, to prevent Tautologies, Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences, and all unſeemly Expreſſions in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he would not have them tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves preciſely to one particular Form of Words (tho' of their own compoſing) ſo as to deny themſelves any Liberty of uſing another, or add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that; but to furniſh themſelves with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Words for various Emergencies, ſo as to be able to add or alter, as Occaſion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And could the Wiſdom of Man direct to a better Method for Piety and Devotion in thoſe bad times?</p>
            <p>But 'tis ſometimes (ſay you) not ſo much the Evidence of Truth, as the Revolutions of Times, that alter Mens Practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed, Sir, for this if applied to this great Man, as here without great Impertinence it muſt be, will diſparage his Memory to purpoſe; by making him a Time-ſerver, and one that ſteer'd his Courſe, as the Temptations of proſperous and adverſe Times led him: Which is enough to deſtroy the Credit, both of the Author and the Book, and put all Men out of Conceit with his variable Gift.</p>
            <p>What you ſay and quote, touching his Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is conſider'd in another Letter, to which I refer you.</p>
            <p>To what I added in the Cloſe, that we may better eſtimate Mens Opinions by the Practice of their latter and wiſer Age, than the Rawneſs of younger Years: You reply,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That ſome who have been ſound and hopeful in their Youth, have extreamly degenerated in their riper Years, and from a great Zeal to the Church and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, have fallen into a great Luke-warmneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from both:</hi> But,</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:31614:93"/>
            <p>Sir, Is there any Rule without an Exception? May it not be reaſonably hop'd and ſuppos'd, that the Generality of Men ſhould grow wiſer and better, as they grow older? And that the Gravity and Experience of Age, ſhould correct the Raſhneſs and Vanity of their Youth? Tho' it muſt be granted, That too many, either by Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, or Strength of Prejudice, or Power of bad Habits and Cuſtoms, or Byaſs of Intereſt, or other corrupt Inclinations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns may be found to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But I hope, you will not here again diſparage the Memory of this great Man, by making him one of this Number.</p>
            <p>For a Cloſe of all, I muſt, upon an Impartial Review of the whole, leave it to the Judgment of the Candid Reader, and your own ſerious Conſideration, how much you might grow wiſer and better, by following the Example of this great Man, which was, and ſtill is, the hearty Wiſh and Advice of,</p>
